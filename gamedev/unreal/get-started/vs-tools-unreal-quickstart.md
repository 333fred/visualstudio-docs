# Quickstart: Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine

In this article, download an Unreal Engine (UE) game sample and use Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine to:

- [View Unreal Engine Blueprints in Visual Studio](#view-unreal-engine-blueprints-in-visual-studio)
- [View Unreal Engine logging within Visual Studio](#view-unreal-engine-logging-within-visual-studio)
- [View Unreal Engine macros in Visual Studio](#view-unreal-engine-macros-in-visual-studio)

## Prerequisites

The following must be installed:

- Visual Studio version 17.10 or later.
- Unreal Engine version 5 or later because the example used in this quickstart requires Unreal Engine 5 or later.
- Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine. See [Install Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine](vs-tools-unreal-install.md) for installation instructions.

## Download and build the Lyra game sample in Visual Studio

Lyra is a sample game project for learning about Unreal Engine. See the **Downloading the Lyra Starter Game** section at [Lyra Sample Game](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/) for download instructions.

## Configure the Lyra game sample to use Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine

After you download the game sample, update `LyraStarterGame.uproject` to use the Visual Studio Tools plugin. You could also do this in the Unreal Editor after loading the Lyra project from the main menu under **Edit** > **Plugins** and then find the *Visual Studio Integration Tools* plugin and check the box next to it.

1. Open the `LyraStarterGame.uproject` file in a text editor. It's in the directory where you installed the game sample.
1. Add the following to the end of the `Plugins` section:

    ```json
    ,{
        "Name": "VisualStudioTools",
        "Enabled": true
    }
    ```

1. Open the Lyra project in Unreal Engine.
1. From the Unreal Engine editor main menu, choose **Tools** > **Generate Visual Studio Project**. This creates the solution file for Visual Studio.
1. From the Unreal Engine editor main menu, choose **Tools** > **Open Visual Studio**. This opens the game in Visual Studio. If you have multiple versions of Visual Studio on your machine, ensure that the right version opened: from the Visual Studio main menu, choose **Help** > **About Microsoft Visual Studio**. You need to use Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7 or higher. If the right version didn't open, manually open `LyraStarterGame.sln` in the correct version of Visual Studio.
1. Change the **Solutions Configurations** dropdown to **Development Editor**. This enables the Blueprints Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine:
    :::image type="content" source="../media/unreal-engine-configuration-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio with the Solutions Configurations dropdown expanded and Development Editor selected.":::
1. From the Visual Studio main menu, choose **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the game.

## View Unreal Engine Blueprints in Visual Studio

You can view, but not edit, UE Blueprints from within Visual Studio. This is useful because you can see UE Blueprints without having to switch between the Unreal Editor and Visual Studio. To try it out, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio, open `LyraCharacter.h`. Either search for that file in the Search pane of the **Solution Explorer** or find it under **Games** > **LyraStarterGame** > **Source** > **LyraGame** > **Character** > **LyraCharacter.h**
1. In `LyraCharacter.h`, go to line 96. You should see the following class: `class LYRAGAME_API ALyraCharacter : public AModularCharacter ...`
1. There are four Blueprint classes that extend this class. You should see a link just above the `ALyraCharacter` class definition that says: `4 derived Blueprint classes`. Click that link to view the four Blueprint classes that extend this class:
    :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-blueprints-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the blueprints link above the Alyra Character class. It lists related blueprints." lightbox="../media/vs-blueprints-link.png":::
1. To view the properties of the `Character_Default_C` Blueprint, double-click it to open the Blueprint asset viewer. You can view the various properties of the Blueprint, but you can't change them:
    :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-blueprints-asset-viewer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Character_Default_C Blueprint asset viewer. It shows properties such as Actor, Camera, Character, Collision, and so on.":::

## View Unreal Engine logging within Visual Studio

You can use the Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine to view UE logging within Visual Studio. This is useful because you can see UE logging without having to switch between the Unreal Editor and Visual Studio. To try it out, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio, open `LyraGameplayAbility_RangedWeapon.cpp`. Either search for that file in the Search pane of the **Solution Explorer** or find it under **Games** > **LyraStarterGame** > **Source** > **LyraGame** > **Weapons** > **LyraGameplayAbility_RangedWeapon.cpp**
1. In `LyraGameplayAbility_RangedWeapon.cpp`, go to line 477. You should see this function: `void ULyraGameplayAbility_RangedWeapon::OnTargetDataReadyCallback`
1. Insert the following code at the beginning of the function: `UE_LOG(LogLyra, Log, TEXT("shot fired"));` This creates a log entry, associated with the category `LogLyra`, that logs `shot fired` when this function is called.
1. Run the sample game in Visual Studio by choosing **Debug** > **Start Debugging**. Give the Unreal Editor a few moments to load the Lyra game.
1. In Visual Studio, open the UE logging window by choosing **View** > **Other Windows** > **Unreal Engine Log** from the Visual Studio main menu. Or use the UE toolbar button to show the log (see the [Unreal Engine toolbar](#unreal-engine-toolbar) section for details).
1. In the Unreal Editor, choose the Play button on the toolbar (or `Alt+p`) to start the game.
1. In the Lyra game, use the `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys to navigate the player left to the **Elimination** portal. Position the player over the entry portal to load the game.
1. Once the game is running, click the mouse button to fire. This creates some log entries in the `LogLyra` category. Now `LogLyra` will appear in the Categories filter for the next step.
1. Reduce log noise by filtering all but the `LogLyra` category events in the UE logging window as follows: choose the **Categories** dropdown. Choose **(Select All)** at the top of the list to clear all of the log sources. Then select **LogLyra**. In the UE logging window, you should see the log message: `shot fired`:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-unreal-engine-log.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Unreal Engine Log window showing 'shot fired' events and the Categories dropdown with LogLyra selected.":::

    The events are at the bottom of the log so you might have to scroll down to see them. You could also choose the **Clear** button to clear the log and then fire again to see the log message.

If you find the font color hard to read, you can adjust it under **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Fonts and Colors**. Change the dropdown **Show settings for:** to **Unreal Engine Log**. In **Display items:** select **Log** and change the **Item foreground** color to something easier to see for you.

Having the UE logging window open while you're debugging is convenient because you don't have to switch to the Unreal Editor to see them.

## View Unreal Engine macros in Visual Studio

Long UE macros can be difficult to read. Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine expands UE macros so that you can read them more easily. You can copy the expanded macro if you want. You can also search for it online or compare it with another macro. To experiment with these features, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio, open `LyraGameplayAbility_RangedWeapon.cpp`. Either search for that file in the Search pane of the **Solution Explorer** or find it under **Games** > **LyraStarterGame** > **Source** > **LyraGame** > **Weapons** > **LyraGameplayAbility_RangedWeapon.cpp**
1. In `LyraGameplayAbility_RangedWeapon.cpp`, go to line 41. You should see the following macro: `UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_STATIC(TAG_WeaponFireBlocked, "Ability.Weapon.NoFiring");`
1. Hover the mouse pointer over `UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_STATIC` to see the macro definition window:
    :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-unreal-engine-macro-tooltip.png" alt-text="A screenshot in Visual Studio of the UE macro tooltip. There are options at the bottom to copy, expand inline, visualize expansion, and search online." lightbox="../media/vs-unreal-engine-macro-tooltip.png":::
    The options at the bottom copy the macro to the clipboard, expand the macro inline, visualize the macro's expansion, and search online for the macro.
1. Choose **Expand Inline**, to expand the macro, and all nested macros, in the code window.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-unreal-engine-macro-expanded-inline.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the expanded contents of the UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_STATIC macro." lightbox="../media/vs-unreal-engine-macro-expanded-inline.png":::
    You can press `Ctrl+z` to undo the expansion.
1. Choose **Search online** to open your browser. It opens with a search populated to find the macro. In the previous example, this opens the browser to search for `C++ #define UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_STATIC(TagName, Tag) static FNativeGameplayTag TagName(UE_PLUGIN_NAME, UE_MODULE_NAME,  â€¦`
1. Choose **Visualize the expansion** to open the **Macro Expansion** window. You can expand the nested macros that are part of the larger macro one step at a time. Scroll to the end of the expansion to see the macro expansion arrows in the upper-right corner of the window. Choose the right arrow to expand the next nested macro. Choose the left arrow to collapse the last nested macro that was expanded:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-unreal-engine-macro-expansion.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the macro expansion window showing the expanded contents of the UE_DEFINE_GAMEPLAY_TAG_STATIC macro.":::

For more information about expanding macros in Visual Studio, see [Visualize C/C++ macro expansion](/cpp/ide/visualize-macro-expansion).

This quickstart showed how Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine makes it easier to understand UE macros, view UE logging, and view UE Blueprints. May your UE development work be more productive and enjoyable!

## Unreal Engine toolbar

Visual Studio provides a toolbar that improves the Unreal Engine development experience. The toolbar provides quick access to common UE tasks. 

Activate the Unreal Engine toolbar in Visual Studio from the main menu via **View** > **Toolbars** > **Unreal Engine**. The toolbar looks like:

:::image type="content" source="../media/ue-toolbar.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Unreal Engine toolbar in Visual Studio.":::

The toolbar buttons, left to right, are as follows:

- A quick attach button (the play icon) and a dropdown listing the name of the process to attach to. The dropdown lists Unreal Engine related processes, which makes it easier to attach to the Unreal Engine Editor more easily.
- Buttons to start and stop the Unreal Engine integration server. The integration server improves the performance of the Unreal Engine integration with Visual Studio. It runs as a background process that so that Blueprint and test information is automatically updated as you work on your project. You can turn it off to reclaim resources if your machine is resource constrained, and start it when you want the integration improvements. The server is started automatically when you open a UE project in Visual Studio.
- A button to rescan Unreal Engine blueprint assets.
- A button that opens the Unreal Engine log window.
- A button to configure Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine. This opens the **Unreal Engine Integration Configuration** window where you can refresh and see the overall configuration status and Visual Studio Integration Tool status, check for blueprint support, see whether get Unreal Engine naming convention checker status, and so on.

## Add Unreal Engine modules in Visual Studio

You can now add Unreal Engine [modules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-modules) to your Unreal Engine project from within Visual Studio. This is useful because you don't have to switch between the Unreal Editor and Visual Studio to add a module, or have to synchronize the Visual Studio solution with your Unreal Engine project file afterwards.

To try adding an UE module in Visual Studio, follow these steps. The steps assume that you have the LyraStarterGame project solution file (`.sln`) open in Visual Studio:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose a project, such as **LyraStarterGame**, where you want the new module to go.
1. Right-click the project (be sure a project is selected and not a folder) and choose **Add** > **Unreal Engine item...**. This opens the **Add New Item** dialog:
     :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-add-new-ue-item-dialog-module.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the add item menu. In solution explorer, a folder is selected and Add > Unreal Engine Item... is selected in the menu.":::
1. Choose **Unreal Engine Module**, provide a module name in the **Name** field, and then choose **Add**. This opens the **Add Unreal Engine Module** dialog:
    :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-add-unreal-engine-module-dialog.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the add new item dialog. It has options for adding an Unreal Engine Common Classes, Empty Unreal Engine Module (which is selected), and Unreal Engine Plugins.":::
1. Change the module name and use the drop-downs to select the module type and loading phase. Choose **Add** to add the module to the project and update the Visual Studio solution file.

Modules can only be created in the **Source** folder or as a module of a plugin inside the **Plugins** folder.\
The **Build** path shows where the **Build.cs** file will be created. The Build.cs file contains the configuratoin 

## Add Unreal Engine classes in Visual Studio

You can now add Unreal Engine classes to your Unreal Engine project from within Visual Studio. This is useful because you don't have to switch between the Unreal Editor and Visual Studio to add a class, or have to synchronize the Visual Studio solution with your Unreal Engine project file afterwards.

To try it out, follow these steps in Visual Studio, which assume that you have the LyraStarterGame project open in Visual Studio:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose a folder where you want the new class to go. In the LyraStarterGame project, you could add a new class to the **LyraStarterGame** > **Source** folder, for example.
1. Right-click the folder and choose **Add** > **Unreal Engine item...**. This opens the **Add New Item** dialog:
    :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-add-new-ue-item-dialog-class.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the add new item dialog. It has options for adding an Unreal Engine Common Classes (which is selected), Empty Unreal Engine Module, and Unreal Engine Plugins.":::
1. Choose **Unreal Engine Common Classes** and then choose **Add**. This opens the **Add Unreal Engine Class** dialog.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/vs-add-unreal-engine-class-dialog.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the add new Unreal Engine class dialog. It has options for selecting a base such a none, Actor, Character, and Actor component, and so on. There are fields for the class name and the module to add the class to. The paths to the header file and source file are listed. A checkbox is selected to refresh intellisense information using Unreal Editor tools.":::
1. Choose a base class, such as **Actor**. Choose a module to add to your class using the mixin pattern using the **Select a module to add the class** dropdown. You can choose whether Visual Studio will use Unreal Editor tools to update the intellisense information. Then choose **Add** which adds the class to the folder you selected and updates the Visual Studio solution file. This will result in a prompt to reload the project. Choose **Reload** to reload the project if you intend to keep working from within Visual Studio.
