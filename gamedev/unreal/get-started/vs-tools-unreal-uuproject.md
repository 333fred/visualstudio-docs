# Open native Unreal Engine projects in Visual Studio

Use the Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine (UE) to open native Unreal Engine projects in Visual Studio. This is useful because you don't have to sync the changes you make back and forth between the Visual Studio version of the project and the native Unreal Engine version of the project.

## Prerequisites

The following must be installed:

- Visual Studio version 17.10 or later.
- Unreal Engine version 5 or later.
- Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine. See [Install Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine](vs-tools-unreal-install.md) for installation instructions.
- Complete the [Quickstart: Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine](vs-tools-unreal-quickstart.md) to download and build the Lyra game and configure it to use Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine.

## Open a native Unreal Engine project in Visual Studio

1. In Visual Studio, open the **File** menu, and then select **Open** > **Project/Solution**.
