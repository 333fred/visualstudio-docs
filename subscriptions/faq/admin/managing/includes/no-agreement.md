## Why am I not seeing an agreement while logged into the portal?

If you are logged into the [subscription management portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com/) and you don't see one of your agreements:
1. Verify youâ€™re signed in with the correct email address and tenant in the upper right-hand corner of the portal page header.
2. Ask a super admin to verify that you're using the right sign-in address, you're shown as an admin, and the agreement is not expired.
If none of these simple solutions solve the issue, contact support to verify you're an admin on the agreement.
