## What is the GitHub setup process?

GitHub Enterprise is set up and managed separately from Visual Studio subscriptions. Following a Visual Studio subscription with GitHub Enterprise purchase, a GitHub Enterprise account setup process is initiated in parallel with (but separate from) establishing an agreement in the [Management portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com). Establishing this GitHub Enterprise account may take some time.  
After your company has set up a GitHub Enterprise account, subscribers who have been assigned Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise will receive an email from GitHub notifying them that their Visual Studio subscriptions have been linked.  They can then reach out to their GitHub organization administrator for an invitation to the appropriate organization.
