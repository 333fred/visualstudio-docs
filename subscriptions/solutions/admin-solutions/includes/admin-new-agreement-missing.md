## My new agreement is missing, where is it?
You will be able to sign in to the admin portal after the agreement has been entered into the system, or you have been assigned a super admin/admin role to begin managing subscriptions. You will receive an email from Visual Studio Subscriptions when your new agreement has been added, or when you’ve been assigned a super admin/admin role.

In most cases, you’re likely viewing an older agreement and can find your new one by checking the dropdown on the left side of the screen above your assigned subscriptions. Click on the agreement number to start managing that agreement.

Make sure that you are signing in with the email address that the permissions were given to and f your company uses Azure Active Directory, check to make sure the correct tenant is selected in the top right corner. 

If you’re still unable to see your agreement it could be due to a caching issue. Try signing in on a private browser.
