## Where can I find out the status of a new or existing agreement?

Near the top of the page in the [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), there's a dropdown where you can choose which agreement to view. Next to that dropdown, you can see the agreement status, start date, and end date. For more details, select the second icon on the left pane to open the information panel.
