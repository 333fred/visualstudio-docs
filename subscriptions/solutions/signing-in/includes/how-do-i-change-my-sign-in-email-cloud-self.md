## How to change your sign-in email address

If your work or school purchased subscriptions through Volume Licensing or the Visual Studio Marketplace, those subscriptions are managed by admins. An admin can change the email address you use to sign into your subscription.  

## How to contact your admin 

Given the size and complexity of many organizations, you may not be aware of who your admin is. You can use the **Contact my admin** feature in the subscriptions portal to assist with contacting your admin. 

1. Navigate to the [Subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) in the portal  
2. Click the **Contact my Admin** button at the top right
3. Enter the message for your admin
4. If you'd like to receive a copy of the message sent to your admin, check the **Send me a copy** checkbox 
5. Click **Send**

## How can I change the sign-in email of my Visual Studio Subscription?
Each subscription type is managed in a different way – some can only be transferred by Visual Studio Subscriptions support; others are managed by your company. In order to check which subscription type you have, go to the [Subscriptions tab](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), click the “support information” link and compare the subscription channel with the below listing:

- Retail – Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using link at the bottom of the page
- MCT - Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using link at the bottom of the page
- VL – click the “contact my admin” button on the top part of the website
- Monthly/Annual through Marketplace – contact the administrator who purchased the subscriptions through Azure
- PartnerCenter – Contact your company administrator
- Free – anyone can join a free program, there's no need to transfer

If your subscription level is different, reach out to the admin that assigned the subscription.
