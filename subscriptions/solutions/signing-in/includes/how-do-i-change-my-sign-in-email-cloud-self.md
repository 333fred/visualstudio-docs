## How can I change the sign-in address on my Visual Studio cloud subscription?

If you purchased one or more cloud subscriptions for yourself, you were set up as an administrator, with the ability to make changes to the subscriptions.  To change the email address you need to sign in, you will need to access the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal and edit your subscription.

1. Sign in to [https://manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com). 
0. Locate your subscription in the list, click on the **...** and choose **Edit**.
0. Your subscription information will be displayed in a fly-out pane on the right.
0. Change the email address as desired.
0. Click **Save**.

Note: This does not change the email address you use to sign in to the Administration Portal.
