## Migrate from Office 365 E3 to Microsoft 365 E5 

If you have an old Office 365 E3 developer sandbox subscription activated through Visual Studio Subscriptions, you can migrate to Microsoft 365 E5. If you would like to migrate to a new Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription, you'll need to delete your current subscription and replace it.

1. On your subscription tile, select Delete subscription. 
1. Confirm that you want to delete your subscription by typing the name of your domain in the dialog box. 
1. The setup process for your new Microsoft 365 E5 subscription starts automatically. 

After you delete your Office 365 E3 subscription and create your replacement Microsoft 365 E5 subscription, your Office 365 E3 tenant will be available for 60 days so that you can migrate your data.
