## Visual Studio IDE technical support  

Visual Studio Subscriptions support provides assistance with sales, subscriptions, accounts and billing. If you have a Visual Studio IDE technical issue or question, your question needs to be directed to [Visual Studio technical support](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/). Before you use your limited [Visual Studio technical support incidents](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-tech-support) that may be included with your Visual Studio subscription, we suggest trying some other online resources.

## Developer community 

Search the online [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/) and get expert answers from a community supported forum. You can search keywords and read, vote, comment all without logging in.  

If you don’t find what you need with a search, you can suggest a feature or report a problem from the navigation menu. To submit a feature request, you’ll need to sign in to fill out the report and post. To report a problem or bug, a running instance of Visual Studio is required in order to report feedback.   

## Stack overflow 

A open community for anyone that codes. Search the [public Q&A tagged with visual-studio](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio?tab=Newest) to get answers to already asked questions or sign up for an account and ask a new question.  

## Visual Studio IDE documentation 

Review tutorials, troubleshooting guides, helpful resources, and a range of other topics within [Visual Studio IDE documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/). 

## Support incidents 

If you’ve exhausted the options above and still don’t have an answer, activate a Visual Studio technical support ticket by visiting the [subscriptions portal benefits page](https://my.visualstudio.com/Benefits) and clicking on the Technical Support benefit tile in the Support tab. Read more about the [Technical Support benefit](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-tech-support).
