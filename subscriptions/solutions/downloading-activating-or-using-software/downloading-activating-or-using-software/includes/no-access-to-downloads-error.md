## "You don't have access to downloads" error on downloads page
If you see this error when you visit the downloads page, your administrator has disabled access to downloads for your subscription(s). For more details, please contact your administrator.

Alternatively, you'll only see products available to the free Dev Essentials subscription if you have one activated, despite having a paid subscription.

Should that happen, you should reach out to the administrator that assigned the subscription to you:
1. For monthly or annual subscriptions purchased through Azure, reach out to the owner of the account that was used for purchase
2. For Volume Licensing subscriptions assigned by your company, click the “contact my admin” at the top of the [Subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions)

If you have additional questions, open a case with Visual Studio Subscriptions support by clicking on the "Online request" link on this page.
