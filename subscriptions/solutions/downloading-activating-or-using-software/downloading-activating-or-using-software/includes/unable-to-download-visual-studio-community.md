## I'm Unable to download or activate Visual Studio Community

Visual Studio Community is the free, lightweight version of the IDE and you don't need a paid Visual Studio subscription to use it. You can [download this directly](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) from the Visual Studio website.  

In order to use Visual Studio Community, join the [free Visual Studio Dev Essentials program](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/dev-essentials/).
