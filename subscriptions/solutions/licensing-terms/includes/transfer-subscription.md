## Can I transfer my subscription and all rights included to another user?

According to the licensing whitepaper, subscriptions can be transferred to other users. When that happens, the previous owner of the subscription loses the rights to the software and keys they've claimed prior to the transfer.

For more details, [view the Microsoft Visual Studio licensing whitepaper](https://aka.ms/VSLicensingPaper). 

## How do I initiate a subscription transfer?
Each subscription type is managed in a different way – some can only be transferred by Visual Studio Subscriptions support; others are managed by your company. In order to check which subscription type you own, go to the subscriptions page, click the “support information” link and compare the subscription channel with the below listing:

- Retail – Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using the "Online request" button on this page
- MCT - Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using the "Online request" button on this page
- VL – click the “contact my admin” button at the top of the [Subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions)
- Cloud – contact the admin who purchased the subscriptions through Azure
- PartnerCenter – Contact your company admin
- Free – anyone can join the free Dev Essentials program, there's no need to transfer

If your subscription type is different, you need to reach out to the party that provided you with the subscription in the first place.
