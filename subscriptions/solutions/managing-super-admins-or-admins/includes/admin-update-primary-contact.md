## Our primary contact left, and I'm the new one. How can I update the contact info?

As the new primary contact, there are a few steps you’ll need to complete to update your information.
1.	Contact to your reseller and let them know you are the new primary contact so they can update the information on the contract
2.	Wait 48 hours for the portal to update and grant you the appropriate permissions
3.	If you're still unable to see your super admin permissions, contact support by clicking the "Online support" button below to submit a ticket. Include the agreement number and email address to be assigned.
    
## How can I update the primary contact on the admin portal?
Once you've updated your primary contact information, sign into the admin portal and verify the previous primary contact is no longer reflecting there. Ensure you have at least two current super admins to remove the one that has left. By system design, you can’t have just one, there must always be two super admins on the agreement.
