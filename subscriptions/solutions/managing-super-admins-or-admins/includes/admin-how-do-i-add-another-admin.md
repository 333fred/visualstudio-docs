## How to add another super admin or admin

There are two distinct roles, admins and super admins. Admins can assign, edit or remove subscriptions, and super admins have the additional ability to assign, edit, or remove admins or other super admins.

1.	Ensure you've been added as a super admin
2.	At the top of the admin portal, navigate to the **Manage administrators** page, then select the appropriate agreement from the dropdown
3.	Click **Add**
4.	Fill out the required fields â€“ you'll check the box for the super admin role or fill out the information without checking the box for just the admin role 

## More Information

To check if you're a super admin, select the agreement details icon to the left side of the portal and a flyout panel will show you those details. 

The super admin role isn't available for [MPSA agreements](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/mpsa), as administrator permissions for those agreement types are managed in the Microsoft [Business Center](https://businessaccount.microsoft.com/Customer). 

To [manage administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/cloud-admin) for subscriptions purchased through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
