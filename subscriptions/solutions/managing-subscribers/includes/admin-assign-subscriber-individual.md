## How do I add a single user to my agreement?

As a super admin/admin you can assign an individual subscriber by following these steps. 
1.	Make sure you’re looking at the correct agreement on the left above the subscriber grid 
2.	Next, select **Add** and then **Individual subscriber**
3.	Enter all of the required information and click **Add**

## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) 

The admin must be a member of the Azure AZ tenant to use this method.
1.	Check to be sure that you have the correct tenant selected in the upper right corner
2.	Make sure you’re looking at the correct agreement on the left above the subscriber grid 
3.	Next, select **Add** and then “Individual subscriber”
4.	If your organization is using Azure AD, the **Name** field will act as a search function to find people in your current directory and you can select the correct user from the search results
5.	After selecting the user, the sign-in email and notification email will automatically populate, however you can change them if necessary
6.	Enter all of the required information and select **Add**
