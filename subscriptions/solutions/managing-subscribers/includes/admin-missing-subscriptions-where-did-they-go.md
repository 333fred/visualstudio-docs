## Some subscriptions are missing that I didn’t delete, where did they go?

As the super admin/admin you can add, edit or remove subscribers from any agreement as long as you have the proper permissions. 

However, it’s a best practice to have more than one admin per agreement with the same capabilities. If you notice changes you didn’t make, complete the following steps to determine who made the changes.

1.	Select the **Dashboard** tab above the subscriber grid
2.	Navigate to the “Recent changes” tile. Click on **View all changes** link in the bottom-right corner, or the Excel icon in the upper-right corner to export a file, and view a report of the changes completed in the last 30 days. For privacy reasons, we only retain information for the last 30 days.

## Account closed by subscriber 
Subscriptions could also be missing if the subscriber requested that Microsoft close their account. When we receive requests for account closure, we're required to delete their data. We're unable to tell you which end user submitted the request.
