# What happens when you change Visual Studio subscription levels?
In Visual Studio subscriptions, the software, tools, services, and other benefits available to you depend on your subscription level.  Generally, the higher your subscription level, the more robust the benefits it provides.  

There may be scenarios where you start with one subscription level and either increase (upgrade) or decrease (downgrade) to another level.  Examples of those scenarios include:
- You decide you need a more full-featured version of the Visual Studio IDE or access to a broader selection of software downloads, so you choose to upgrade. 
- Your company's subscription administrator may choose to change your subscription level based on your current role or project, or changes in your company's purchasing plans. 

Based on whether you upgrade or downgrade, and which subscription level you have, you may need to take action to access benefits in your new subscription.
