# Visual Studio subscriptions in a Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA)

If you've purchased Visual Studio Subscriptions through the MPSA program, there are a few things to be aware of before you can become a Visual Studio subscriptions admin and assign subscriptions to your users. If you've already been set up as an admin, you can go directly to the Visual Studio subscriptions [Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com/).

MPSA customers manage assets purchased through MPSA in a portal called the [Business Center](https://businessaccount.microsoft.com/Customer) that supports functionalities similar to the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). These include viewing your License Summary, Orders, Downloads, Keys, Users, etc. However, Visual Studio subscriptions in MPSA behave much like Cloud Services. The Business Center also uses work accounts to sign in, instead of Microsoft Accounts (MSA). If you access services like Azure Active Directory or Office 365, your email is already a work account. This will allow you to register to Business Center with your existing password. If your organization isn't using cloud services and your email isn't a work account, you may use it to register to the Business Center.

The Visual Studio subscriptions [Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com/) is where you'll assign subscriptions after you become a Visual Studio subscriptions admin. In MPSA, Visual Studio subscriptions must be provisioned to their respective management portal, which is the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal. To do that, you need to associate your Purchasing Account to a tenant (example: contoso.onmicrosoft.com).

There are two types of tenants - managed tenants and unmanaged tenants. A managed tenant refers to a tenant that is already being managed by admins within the organization.

An unmanaged tenant is a tenant without any admins assigned and isn't usable for Online Services such as Office 365. Unmanaged tenants are also created when registering to the Business Center with an email that isn't a work account. If you created a password when you registered on the Business Center, your email wasn't a work account. So an unmanaged tenant was created.

Prerequisites to become a Visual Studio Subscriptions administrator

## Managed tenant

Follow these steps to set up a managed tenant:

1. First, the Purchasing Account must be associated with your company domain/tenant. The association is performed in the Business Center Portal. 
To associate your account, you must
   - Be a registered user in the Business Center Portal with an Account Administrator or Account Manager role
   - Be a Global Administrator (Company Administrator) or a Billing Administrator in the tenant to which you'd like to link your Purchasing Account.

   After you've ensured you have these roles assigned to the same work account, follow the below steps to perform the association:

   1. Log in to Business Center.
   2. Select the **Account** tab and choose **Associate Domains**.
   3. Select your **Purchasing Account** (if you have more than one).
   4. Select your **tenant** (example: contoso.onmicrosoft.com).
   5. Select Associate Domain.

   For a more detailed explanation for this process, you may use the Quick Start guides. Download the guide named "Set up and Use Your Online Services".

   If you're experiencing issues with the domain association or require guidance, contact Business Center support.

2. After the Purchasing Account has been associated to your domain, to administer Visual Studio subscriptions on the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal, you must have at least one of the below roles in either of the user portals. Having more than one of these roles across the two portals is also possible. However, just one is enough, regardless of which portal it is:

   Qualifying roles on the Business Center Portal:

   + Account Administrator
   + Account Manager 
   
   Qualifying roles in the tenant Azure Active Directory where the Purchasing Account is associated:
   
   + Global administrator (Company administrator)
   + User Administrator

> [!NOTE]
> For the Azure Active Directory roles, ensure that the “Country or Region” and “Postal code” fields within your user profile in Azure are populated appropriately depending on your region (i.e. US, CA, etc.).

After the domain association, if you have the correct permissions listed above, you'll be able to access the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal within 24 hours. If you don't have access after 24 hours, contact Business Center support.

## Unmanaged tenant

If you registered to the Business Center with an email that wasn't a work account (not registered in the Azure Active Directory “Azure AD”), as explained above, the tenant association will be slightly different. You'll need to perform what’s called a "domain take-over". During this process, you'll make yourself the Global Administrator (Company Administrator) which will change your tenant from "unmanaged" to "managed."

For a more detailed explanation for this process, you may use the Quick Start guides. Download the guide named "Setup and Use Your Online Services" that will guide you through a domain take-over (pg. 7-8).

After you've completed the domain take-over process, you must adhere to the two criteria from section “Managed Tenant” to administer Visual Studio subscriptions on the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal. In you encounter problems, contact Business Center support.
