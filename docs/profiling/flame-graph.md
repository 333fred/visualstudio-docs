# Identify hot paths with a visualized call tree

Flame graphs are a visualization of categorized data, created to visualize stack traces of profiled software so that the most frequent code paths can be identified quickly and accurately.

The **Flame Graph** helps you identify hot paths in your code by visualizing a call tree. This new view is in the CPU tool details tool window, above the source line highlighting view. The graph gives a visual overview of where time is being spent in your application and you can click on specific nodes to dig into them further.
