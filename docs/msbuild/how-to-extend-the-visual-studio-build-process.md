# Extend the Visual Studio build process

The Visual Studio build process is defined by a series of MSBuild *.targets* files that are imported into your project file. These imports are implicit, if you use an SDK as Visual Studio projects usually do. One of these imported files, *Microsoft.Common.targets*, can be extended to allow you to run custom tasks at several points in the build process. This article explains two methods you can use to extend the Visual Studio build process:

- Create a custom target and specify when it should run by using `BeforeTargets` and `AfterTargets` attributes.

- Override specific predefined targets defined in the common targets (*Microsoft.Common.targets* or the files that it imports).

- Override the `DependsOn` properties defined in the common targets.

## AfterTargets and BeforeTargets

You can use `AfterTargets` and `BeforeTargets` attributes on your custom target to specify when it should run.

The following example shows how to use the `AfterTargets` attribute to add a custom target that does something with the output files. In this case, it copies the output files to a new folder *CustomOutput*.  The example also shows how to clean up the files created by the custom build operation with a `CustomClean` target by using a `BeforeTargets` attribute and specifying that the custom clean operation runs before the `CoreClean` target.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
     <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
     <_OutputCopyLocation>$(OutputPath)..\..\CustomOutput\</_OutputCopyLocation>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <Target Name="CustomAfterBuild" AfterTargets="Build">
    <ItemGroup>
      <_FilesToCopy Include="$(OutputPath)**\*"/>
    </ItemGroup>
    <Message Text="_FilesToCopy: @(_FilesToCopy)" Importance="high"/>

    <Message Text="DestFiles:
        @(_FilesToCopy->'$(_OutputCopyLocation)%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')"/>

    <Copy SourceFiles="@(_FilesToCopy)"
          DestinationFiles=
          "@(_FilesToCopy->'$(_OutputCopyLocation)%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')"/>
  </Target>

  <Target Name="CustomClean" BeforeTargets="CoreClean">
    <Message Text="Inside Custom Clean" Importance="high"/>
    <ItemGroup>
      <_CustomFilesToDelete Include="$(_OutputCopyLocation)**\*"/>
    </ItemGroup>
    <Delete Files='@(_CustomFilesToDelete)'/>
  </Target>
</Project>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Be sure to use different names than the predefined targets listed in the table in the next section (for example, the custom build target here is `CustomAfterBuild`, not `AfterBuild`), since those predefined targets are overridden by the SDK import which also defines them.

## Override predefined targets

The common `.targets` files contain a set of predefined empty targets that are called before and after some of the major targets in the build process. For example, MSBuild calls the `BeforeBuild` target before the main `CoreBuild` target and the `AfterBuild` target after the `CoreBuild` target. By default, the empty targets in the common targets do nothing, but you can override their default behavior by defining the targets you want in a project file. By overriding the predefined targets, you can use MSBuild tasks to give you more control over the build process.

But first, if your project uses an SDK (for example `Microsoft.Net.Sdk`), you need to make a change from implicit to explicit imports, as discussed next.

### Implicit imports in SDK-style projects

Projects generated by Visual Studio usually use the `Sdk` attribute on the project element. These types of projects are called SDK-style projects. See [Use MSBuild project SDKs](how-to-use-project-sdk.md). Here's an example:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.Net.Sdk">
```

When your project uses the `Sdk` attribute, two imports are implicitly added, one at the beginning of your project file, and one at the end.

The implicit imports are equivalent to having an import statement like this as the first line in the project file, after the `Project` element:

```xml
<Import Project="Sdk.props" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk" />
```

and the following import statement as the last line in the project file:

```xml
<Import Project="Sdk.targets" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk" />
```

This syntax is referred to as *explicit SDK imports*. When you use this explicit syntax, you should omit the `Sdk` attribute on the project element.

The implicit SDK import is equivalent to importing the specific "common"  `.props` or `.targets` files that is a typical construct in older project files, such as:

```xml
<Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\$(MSBuildToolsVersion)\Microsoft.Common.props" Condition="Exists('$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\$(MSBuildToolsVersion)\Microsoft.Common.props')" />
```

and

```xml
<Import Project="$(MSBuildToolsPath)\Microsoft.CSharp.targets" />
```

Any such old references should be replaced with the explicit SDK syntax shown earlier in this section.

Using the explicit SDK syntax means you can add your own code before the first import, or after the final SDK import. That means you can change the behavior by setting properties before the first import that will take effect in the imported `.props` file, and you can override a target that's defined in one of the SDK `.targets` files after the final import. Using this method, you can override `BeforeBuild` or `AfterBuild` as discussed next.

### To override a predefined target

1. If the project uses the `Sdk` attribute, change that to the explicit import syntax. See [Implicit imports in SDK-style projects](#implicit-imports-in-sdk-style-projects).

1. Identify a predefined target in the common targets that you want to override. See the table below for the complete list of targets that you can safely override.

1. Define the target or targets at the end of your project file, immediately before the `</Project>` tag and after the explicit SDK import. For example:

    ```xml
    <Project>
        <Import Project="Sdk.props" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk" />
        ...
        <Import Project="Sdk.targets" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk" />
        <Target Name="BeforeBuild">
            <!-- Insert tasks to run before build here -->
        </Target>
        <Target Name="AfterBuild">
            <!-- Insert tasks to run after build here -->
        </Target>
    </Project>
    ```

    Note that the `Sdk` attribute on the top-level `Project` element has been removed.

1. Build the project file.

The following table shows all of the targets in the common targets that you can safely override.

|Target name|Description|
|-----------------|-----------------|
|`BeforeCompile`, `AfterCompile`|Tasks that are inserted in one of these targets run before or after core compilation is done. Most customizations are done in one of these two targets.|
|`BeforeBuild`, `AfterBuild`|Tasks that are inserted in one of these targets will run before or after everything else in the build. **Note:**  The `BeforeBuild` and `AfterBuild` targets are already defined in comments at the end of most project files, allowing you to easily add pre- and post-build events to your project file.|
|`BeforeRebuild`, `AfterRebuild`|Tasks that are inserted in one of these targets run before or after the core rebuild functionality is invoked. The order of target execution in *Microsoft.Common.targets* is: `BeforeRebuild`, `Clean`, `Build`, and then `AfterRebuild`.|
|`BeforeClean`, `AfterClean`|Tasks that are inserted in one of these targets run before or after the core clean functionality is invoked.|
|`BeforePublish`, `AfterPublish`|Tasks that are inserted in one of these targets run before or after the core publish functionality is invoked.|
|`BeforeResolveReferences`, `AfterResolveReferences`|Tasks that are inserted in one of these targets run before or after assembly references are resolved.|
|`BeforeResGen`, `AfterResGen`|Tasks that are inserted in one of these targets run before or after resources are generated.|

## Override DependsOn properties

Overriding predefined targets is an easy way to extend the build process, but, because MSBuild evaluates the definition of targets sequentially, there is no way to prevent another project that imports your project from overriding the targets you already have overridden. So, for example, the last `AfterBuild` target defined in the project file, after all other projects have been imported, will be the one that is used during the build.

You can guard against unintended overrides of targets by overriding the DependsOn properties that are used in `DependsOnTargets` attributes throughout the common targets. For example, the `Build` target contains a `DependsOnTargets` attribute value of `"$(BuildDependsOn)"`. Consider:

```xml
<Target Name="Build" DependsOnTargets="$(BuildDependsOn)"/>
```

This piece of XML indicates that before the `Build` target can run, all the targets specified in the `BuildDependsOn` property must run first. The `BuildDependsOn` property is defined as:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <BuildDependsOn>
        BeforeBuild;
        CoreBuild;
        AfterBuild
    </BuildDependsOn>
</PropertyGroup>
```

You can override this property value by declaring another property named `BuildDependsOn` at the end of your project file. By including the previous `BuildDependsOn` property in the new property, you can add new targets to the beginning and end of the target list. For example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <BuildDependsOn>
        MyCustomTarget1;
        $(BuildDependsOn);
        MyCustomTarget2
    </BuildDependsOn>
</PropertyGroup>

<Target Name="MyCustomTarget1">
    <Message Text="Running MyCustomTarget1..."/>
</Target>
<Target Name="MyCustomTarget2">
    <Message Text="Running MyCustomTarget2..."/>
</Target>
```

Projects that import your project files can override these properties without overwriting the customizations that you have made.

#### To override a DependsOn property

1. Identify a predefined DependsOn property in the common targets that you want to override. See the table below for a list of the commonly overridden DependsOn properties.

2. Define another instance of the property or properties at the end of your project file. Include the original property, for example `$(BuildDependsOn)`, in the new property.

3. Define your custom targets before or after the property definition.

4. Build the project file.

### Commonly overridden DependsOn properties

|Property name|Description|
|-------------------|-----------------|
|`BuildDependsOn`|The property to override if you want to insert custom targets before or after the entire build process.|
|`CleanDependsOn`|The property to override if you want to clean up output from your custom build process.|
|`CompileDependsOn`|The property to override if you want to insert custom processes before or after the compilation step.|

## Example: BuildDependsOn and CleanDependsOn

The following example is similar to the `BeforeTargets` and `AfterTargets` example, but shows how to achieve similar functionality. It extends the build by using `BuildDependsOn` to add your own task `CustomAfterBuild` that copies the output files after the build, and also adds the corresponding `CustomClean` task by using `CleanDependsOn`.  

In this example, this is an SDK-style project. As mentioned in the note about SDK-style projects earlier in this article, you must use the manual import method instead of the `Sdk` attribute that Visual Studio uses when it generates project files.

```xml
<Project>
  <Import Project="Sdk.props" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"/>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <Import Project="Sdk.targets" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"/>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <BuildDependsOn>
      $(BuildDependsOn);CustomAfterBuild
    </BuildDependsOn>

    <CleanDependsOn>
      $(CleanDependsOn);CustomClean
    </CleanDependsOn>

    <_OutputCopyLocation>$(OutputPath)..\..\CustomOutput\</_OutputCopyLocation>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <Target Name="CustomAfterBuild">
    <ItemGroup>
      <_FilesToCopy Include="$(OutputPath)**\*"/>
    </ItemGroup>
    <Message Importance="high" Text="_FilesToCopy: @(_FilesToCopy)"/>

    <Message Text="DestFiles:
      @(_FilesToCopy-&gt;'$(_OutputCopyLocation)%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')"/>

    <Copy SourceFiles="@(_FilesToCopy)"
          DestinationFiles="@(_FilesToCopy-&gt;'$(_OutputCopyLocation)%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')"/>
  </Target>

  <Target Name="CustomClean">
    <Message Importance="high" Text="Inside Custom Clean"/>
    <ItemGroup>
      <_CustomFilesToDelete Include="$(_OutputCopyLocation)**\*"/>
    </ItemGroup>
    <Delete Files="@(_CustomFilesToDelete)"/>
  </Target>
</Project>
```

The order of elements is important. The `BuildDependsOn` and `CleanDependsOn` elements must appear after importing the standard SDK targets file.
