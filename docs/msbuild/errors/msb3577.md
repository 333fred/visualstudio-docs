# MSB3577: Two output file names resolved to the same output path: "path"

This error indicates that there is a duplicate filename in the build output.

If you need more information to diagnose the error, first enable a diagnostic log (use the `-verbosity:diag` command-line switch), and check the MSBuild log file with the full diagnostics output. For bigger output logs on large projects, consider using the binary log (`-bl` command-line switch) and the [MSBuild Structured Log Viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/) to view the output more easily.

Check the file in question and try to determine why it's being generated more than once - what are the build processes that are creating it? Can you rename one of the two files?  Is there a duplicate step in the build process, so the same file is being generated more than once?

If this error occurs with content files such as `EmbeddedResource` files, in MSBuild 16.10 and later, you can use `TargetPath` metadata to disambiguate the duplicated path names.

```xml
<Content Include="Files\**">
  <Link>Files\%(Filename)%(Extension)</Link>
  <TargetPath>%(Filename)%(Extension)</TargetPath>
  <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest<CopyToOutputDirectory>
</Content>
```
