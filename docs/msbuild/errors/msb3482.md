# MSB3482

This error occurs when MSBuild encounters an error while trying to sign an output file.

The message resembles the following, but this text is followed by additional information from the signing tool:

```output
MSB3482: An error occurred while signing:
```

Make sure the signing tool is installed; it's installed with Visual Studio. Look to the additional information provided by the signing tool to see more about what happened.

Test certificates expire after a period of time. You might have to create a new one. See [How to: Sign application and deployment manifests](../../ide/how-to-sign-application-and-deployment-manifests.md) or for newer .NET projects in Visual Studio 2019 or later, see [Deploy a .NET Windows Desktop application using ClickOnce](../../deployment/quickstart-deploy-using-clickonce-folder.md).

When running in a non-interactive environment, such as a script in a pipeline, you can create a certificate by using the command-line tool [certutil](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil).

```cmd
certutil –f –p [certificate_password] –importpfx <path to pfx file>
```
