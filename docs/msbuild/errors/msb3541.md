# MSB3541

This error occurs when an invalid value for an MSBuild element or attribute was found during the processing of a project file.

The message resembles the following, but this text is followed by the exception text from the underlying code:

```output
MSB3541: 'entity' has invalid value 'value'.
```

For example, if the project file contains  invalid characters in an item specification such as 'Files' then the message says "Files has invalid value."

Look to the exception message provided by the underlying code to determine the cause of the problem.

Check the syntax of the element and its attributes that resulted in the error.
