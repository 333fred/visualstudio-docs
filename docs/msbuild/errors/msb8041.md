# MSB8041: MFC Libraries are required for this project

This error occurs when MFC is required for a build, but it was not found.

Try installing MFC. Open the Visual Studio Installer, choose **Modify**, and choose a version of the MFC library under **Individual Components**. Make sure the version and architecture of MFC you install matches the expected by the project you're building. There is a version of MFC for each version of the C++ build tools. For example, **C++ MFC for latest v142 build tools (x86 and x64)**. 

For more information, see [Modify Visual Studio](../install/modify-visual-studio.md).
