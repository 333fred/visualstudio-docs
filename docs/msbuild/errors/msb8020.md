# MSBuild error MSB8020

> MSB8020: The build tools for *toolset-name* (Platform Toolset = '*platform-toolset*') cannot be found. To build using the *platform-toolset* build tools, please install *toolset-name* build tools.  Alternatively, you may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then selecting "Retarget solution".

To resolve this issue, upgrade the project to use the current Visual Studio toolset.

:::moniker range=">=vs-2022"
In Visual Studio 2022, the UI has changed and there is no longer a **Retarget solution** menu option. Instead, in the project properties, under **General**, change the **Platform toolset** to **Visual Studio 2022**.
:::moniker-end

Alternatively, use the Visual Studio Installer to install the specified build toolset. For more information, see [Modify Visual Studio](../../install/modify-visual-studio.md). Use the **Individual components** tab in the installer to choose specific platform toolsets.
