# MSB4025

This error occurs when MSBuild tries to load the project file, but the project file could not loaded.  The file must be an XML MSBuild file, such as a `.props` file, or `.targets` file, or a file with any other extension that contains XML that is intended to be interpreted by MSBuild.

The message resembles the following, but this text might be followed by additional information:

```output
MSB4024: The imported project file 'filename' could not be loaded.
```

Look to the additional information provided to determine the cause of the problem.
