# MSB3103: Invalid Resx file

This error occurs when there/s an issue with a .resx resource file. When you see this error, another error is displayed with more details. Look to the other error for more information.

## Remarks

The error MSB3103 occurs when MSBuild encounters an invalid `.resx` file during the build process. This error indicates that the `.resx` file cannot be properly read or processed, often due to issues with its XML content or resource data.

## Common Causes

This error can occur in the following scenarios:

1. **Malformed XML**: The `.resx` file contains invalid XML syntax that cannot be parsed.
    - Example: Missing or mismatched XML tags.
2. **Invalid Data Entries**: The `.resx` file includes entries with invalid or unexpected data types.
    - Example: A data entry is missing a required attribute such as `name` or `type`.
3. **Missing or Inaccessible Resources**: The `.resx` file references external resources (e.g., images or files) that are not present in the expected location or are inaccessible.
    - Example: A file path specified in the `.resx` is incorrect or points to a missing file.
4. **Obsolete or Unsupported Elements**: The `.resx` file uses features or elements that are no longer supported by the version of MSBuild or the target framework.
    - Example: Migrating a project from .NET Framework to .NET Core or .NET 6+ without updating the `.resx` files.

## Real-World Scenarios

1. **Migrating projects**: When migrating a legacy project from .NET Framework to .NET Core or .NET 6+, existing `.resx` files may contain elements or attributes that are incompatible with the newer frameworks.
2. **Manual edits to `.resx` files**: Developers manually editing `.resx` files may inadvertently introduce syntax errors or invalid data.
3. **Broken resource links**: Referencing external files (e.g., images or icons) in `.resx` files without ensuring these files are included in the project or accessible during the build.
4. **Corrupted `.resx` files**: Files can become corrupted due to version control conflicts or file encoding changes.

### Resolution

1. **Validate XML Syntax**:
    - Open the `.resx` file in a text editor or IDE that supports XML validation.
    - Check for syntax errors such as mismatched tags or invalid characters.

2. **Check Resource Entries**:
    - Ensure all entries have valid names, types, and values.
    - If external resources are referenced, verify their paths and existence.

3. **Use the ResX Resource Manager**:
    - Consider using tools like [ResX Resource Manager](https://github.com/dotnet/ResXResourceManager) to validate and manage `.resx` files.

4. **Update for Framework Compatibility**:
    - Review changes in resource handling for the target framework.
    - Update `.resx` files to align with the requirements of the new framework.

5. **Revert to a Known Good State**:
    - If the `.resx` file has become corrupted, revert to a previous version from source control.

### Example

Given a `.resx` file with the following invalid XML:

```xml
<data name="WelcomeMessage" xml:space="preserve">
  <value>Welcome to our application!</value>
  <!-- Missing closing tag for <data> -->
```

MSBuild will generate `General.InvalidResxFile` with a message indicating the malformed XML. Fix the issue by properly closing the `<data>` tag:

```xml
<data name="WelcomeMessage" xml:space="preserve">
  <value>Welcome to our application!</value>
</data>
```
