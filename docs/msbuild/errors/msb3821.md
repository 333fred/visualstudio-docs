# MSB3821: Couldn't process file 'path' due to its being in the Internet or Restricted zone or having the mark of the web on the file

When you download web assets such as HTML pages to a Windows device using a browser, the browser inserts a specially formatted comment into the HTML header called the *mark of the web*, which records the security zone of the site from which the page originated. This is intended to protect from potentially malicious pages and enforce the security level on the original site, even after a page from the site is downloaded. MSBuild respects this security restriction, but you can override the restriction by removing the inserted comment. The comment is of the form:

```html
<!-â€“saved from url={url}-->
```

The full message is similar to the following:

```output
Couldn't process file 'path' due to its being in the Internet or Restricted zone or having the mark of the web on the file.
Remove the mark of the web if you want to process these files.
```

Visual Studio also includes security restrictions that detect the mark of the web comment. You can customize these settings
in the **Tools** > **Options** section **Trust Settings**. See [Configure trust settings for files and folders](../../ide/reference/trust-settings.md).
