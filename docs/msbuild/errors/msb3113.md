## Message text

```output
MSB3113: Could not find file 'value'.
```

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Remarks

This error occurs when MSBuild's manifest generation process fails to resolve a dependency or file trying to generate a manifest. The failure typically indicates issues with file accessibility, locking, or missing dependencies required to generate the manifest.

This error is most commonly encountered in the following scenarios:

1. **File locking issues:**
   - Another process (for example, an antivirus scanner, a parallel build task, or a file being opened in another application) is locking the file(s) MSBuild is attempting to access in read/write mode.

2. **Missing or corrupted files:**
   - Input files required for generating the manifest are missing, inaccessible, or corrupted.

3. **File system permissions:**
   - The current build process lacks sufficient permissions to access or modify the files in the working directory.

4. **Concurrent builds:**
   - Multiple build processes are attempting to access the same files simultaneously, leading to conflicts in read/write operations.

## Real-world scenarios

You might encounter this error in the following situations:

- **Containerized build environments:** When building projects inside Docker containers or other isolated CI/CD pipelines, file system permissions or volume mounting issues could prevent MSBuild from accessing necessary files in read/write mode.
- **Network file systems:** Using network shares (e.g., SMB or NFS) as a build directory can introduce latency or file locking issues that interfere with MSBuild's ability to resolve files.
- **Parallel builds:** Running multiple builds concurrently on the same machine (e.g., using `/m` for multi-process builds) without proper isolation can result in conflicts over file access.
- **Antivirus or security software:** Aggressive antivirus or endpoint protection software might lock files temporarily for scanning, causing read/write operations to fail.

### Resolution

Enable detailed MSBuild logging (`/verbosity:diagnostic`) to identify the specific file or operation causing the failure. To resolve this error, try the following:

1. **Check for file locks:**
   - Use tools like [Handle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle) (Windows) to identify processes locking the file.
   - Ensure no other applications or processes are accessing the file.

2. **Verify file existence and integrity:**
   - Confirm that all required input files exist and are not corrupted.

3. **Address file system permissions:**
   - Ensure the user or process running the build has the necessary read/write permissions for the working directory and input/output files.

4. **Isolate build processes:**
   - Avoid running concurrent builds on the same set of files. Use separate directories for parallel builds, or configure your CI/CD pipeline to serialize build steps.

5. **Adjust antivirus settings:**
   - Exclude your build directory from real-time antivirus scanning to prevent file locks during the build process.
