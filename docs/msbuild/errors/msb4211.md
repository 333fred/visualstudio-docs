# MSB4211 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB4211 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB4211: The property 'value' is being set to a value for the first time, but it was already consumed at 'value'.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
<!--
{StrBegin="MSB4211: "}
-->

## Remarks

This error occurs when a target in an MSBuild project file attempts to use a property that has not been initialized. MSBuild expects all properties to have a value before they are accessed.

## Example

Suppose you are building a project, and one of your targets references a property without ensuring it has been set:

```xml
<Project>
  <Target Name="MyTarget">
    <Message Text="Output directory: $(OutputDir)" />
  </Target>
</Project>
```

If `OutputDir` has not been defined, MSBuild will raise the MSB4211 error since the property is accessed without a value.

## Resolution

To resolve this error, ensure that the property in question is initialized before it is used. You can do this in one of the following ways:

1. **Define the property in your project file before it is used**:

   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
     <OutputDir>bin\Debug\</OutputDir>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

2. **Provide a default value using conditions**:

   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
     <OutputDir Condition="'$(OutputDir)' == ''">bin\Debug\</OutputDir>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

3. **Pass the property as a parameter when invoking MSBuild**:

   `msbuild /p:OutputDir=bin\Release`

4. **Provide the property value by using an environment variable.**
   Environment variables are represented in MSBuild as properties with the same name and value.
