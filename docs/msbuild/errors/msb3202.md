# MSB3202

This error occurs when MSBuild can't find a project file with the specified name at the expected location.

The full message is something like the following text:

```output
MSB3202: The project file 'filename' was not found.
```

### Remarks

The MSB3202 error occurs when MSBuild is unable to locate the specified project file. This error is generated when a build is invoked with an incorrect or missing project file path, or incorrect or missing dependent project file.

### Common causes

Below are some real-world scenarios that can lead to this error, especially in modern development and CI/CD environments:

1. **Incorrect File Path in command line or build script**
   - When invoking MSBuild, the specified project file path does not exist or is mistyped.
   - Example:

     `msbuild /p:Configuration=Release NonExistentProject.csproj`

     In this case, MSBuild fails because `NonExistentProject.csproj` does not exist at the specified location.

     Check quotes around paths with spaces.

2. **Project file renamed or deleted**
   - A project file was renamed or removed from the repository, but the build script or CI/CD pipeline was not updated to reflect this change.

3. **Repository checkout issues**
   - During a CI/CD pipeline execution, the source code repository might not be fully checked out, or the necessary project file is excluded due to `.gitignore` rules or shallow cloning.

4. **Cross-platform path issues**
   - In cross-platform development (for example, Windows, Linux, macOS), improper handling of file paths (e.g., using backslashes `\` instead of forward slashes `/`) can result in the project file not being found on non-Windows systems.

5. **Incorrect working directory**
   - The working directory for the MSBuild invocation does not match the location of the project file. This is common when using relative paths in build scripts or when invoking MSBuild programmatically.

### Resolution

1. Verify that the project file exists at the specified location.
   - Use an absolute path to the project file to avoid ambiguity.
   - Example:

     `msbuild C:\Projects\MySolution\MyProject.csproj`

2. Check for typos in the project file name or path in the MSBuild command or build script.

3. Ensure your version control system includes all necessary project files and that the repository checkout is complete.

4. For cross-platform builds, confirm that file paths are constructed correctly for the target operating system.

5. If invoking MSBuild programmatically or via a CI/CD pipeline, ensure the working directory is properly set before executing the build command.
