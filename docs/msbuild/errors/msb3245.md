# MSB3245

This diagnostic code is emitted when MSBuild can't resolve an assembly reference in your project.

The full message resembles the following text:

`MSB3245: Could not resolve this reference. 'assembly' If this reference is required by your code, you may get compilation errors.`

This error might occur if the item is a directory, not a file, or it could occur if the assembly resolver for that reference returns an error. It could be any error that prevents resolution of the reference, such as a missing assembly, misspelled name, version mismatch, mismatched processor architecture, or failed `ProjectReference`.

For a guide on resolving errors with assembly references, see [Troubleshoot assembly references](../troubleshoot-assembly-references.md).

## Remarks

The MSB3245 error in MSBuild is logged in scenarios where the build process fails to resolve a specified assembly reference.

### Possible Causes

1. **Missing Assembly Files**: The assembly file is not present in the specified search paths (e.g., `ReferencePath`, `HintPath`, or the Global Assembly Cache).
2. **Incorrect Project Settings**:
   - The path to the referenced assembly is incorrect or not relative to the project directory.
   - The `HintPath` specified in the project file points to an invalid or outdated location.
3. **Version Mismatch**: The version of the assembly being referenced does not match the version available in the search paths.
4. **Target Framework Issues**: The project targets a framework version that is not installed or does not include the required assembly.
5. **Dependency Resolution Conflicts**: Conflicts arise between different versions of the same assembly referenced by multiple projects in the solution.

### Real-World Scenarios

1. **Upgrading .NET Framework or .NET SDK**:
   - Developers upgrading to a newer version of the .NET SDK or framework may encounter this error if the required assemblies are no longer available or have been replaced.
   - For example, targeting .NET 6 but referencing an assembly built for .NET Framework 4.0.

2. **Cross-Platform Development**:
   - When working on cross-platform solutions, this error may occur if assemblies are not compatible across platforms (e.g., referencing Windows-specific assemblies in a Linux build environment).

3. **Migrating Legacy Projects**:
   - Converting legacy .NET Framework projects to .NET Core or .NET 5+ might result in unresolved references due to missing or incompatible assemblies.

4. **Package Manager Issues**:
   - Dependency resolution issues in NuGet packages, such as conflicting versions or missing transitive dependencies, can trigger this error.

5. **Custom Assembly Locations**:
   - If a project relies on assemblies stored in unconventional locations (e.g., network shares, custom directories) and the paths are not properly configured in the project file.

### Resolutions

1. **Verify Assembly References**:
   - Ensure all referenced assemblies are present in the specified search paths.
   - Update the `HintPath` in the project file to point to the correct location of the assembly.

2. **Install Required Frameworks**:
   - Verify that the target framework or runtime is installed on the build machine.

3. **Resolve Version Conflicts**:
   - Use the `BindingRedirect` element in the app.config or web.config file to resolve version conflicts.
   - Consolidate assembly references to use a single version across the solution.

4. **Ensure NuGet Packages Are Restored**:
   - Run `dotnet restore` or `nuget restore` to ensure all dependencies are downloaded and available.

5. **Enable MSBuild Diagnostic Logging**:
   - Use the `/v:diag` switch to enable verbose logging and identify the specific paths and versions MSBuild is attempting to resolve.
