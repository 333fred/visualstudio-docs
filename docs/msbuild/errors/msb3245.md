# MSB3245

This diagnostic code is emitted when MSBuild can't resolve an assembly reference in your project.

The full message resembles the following text:

`MSB3245: Could not resolve this reference. 'assembly' If this reference is required by your code, you may get compilation errors.`

This error might occur if the item is a directory, not a file, or it could occur if the assembly resolver for that reference returns an error. It could be any error that prevents resolution of the reference, such as a missing assembly, misspelled name, version mismatch, mismatched processor architecture, or failed `ProjectReference`.

For a guide on resolving errors with assembly references, see [Troubleshoot assembly references](../troubleshoot-assembly-references.md).

## Remarks

The MSB3245 error in MSBuild is logged in scenarios where the build process fails to resolve a specified assembly reference.

### Possible causes

1. **Missing assembly files**: The assembly file is not present in the specified search paths (for example, `ReferencePath`, `HintPath`, or the Global Assembly Cache).
2. **Incorrect project settings**:
   - The path to the referenced assembly is incorrect or not relative to the project directory.
   - The `HintPath` specified in the project file points to an invalid or outdated location.
3. **Version mismatch**: The version of the assembly being referenced does not match the version available in the search paths.
4. **Target framework issues**: The project targets a framework version that is not installed or does not include the required assembly.

### Real-World Scenarios

1. **Upgrading .NET Framework or .NET SDK**:
   - Developers upgrading to a newer version of the .NET SDK or framework may encounter this error if the required assemblies are no longer available or have been replaced.
   - For example, targeting .NET 6 but referencing an assembly built for .NET Framework 4.0.

2. **Migrating legacy projects**:
   - Converting legacy .NET Framework projects to .NET Core or .NET 5+ might result in unresolved references due to missing or incompatible assemblies.

3. **Package Manager issues**:
   - Dependency resolution issues in NuGet packages, such as conflicting versions or missing transitive dependencies, can trigger this error.

4. **Custom assembly locations**:
   - If a project relies on assemblies stored in unconventional locations (for example,, network shares, custom directories) and the paths are not properly configured in the project file.

### Resolutions

Enable detailed logging for your MSBuild process by using the `/v:diag` verbosity flag:

```bash
msbuild MyProject.proj /v:diag
```

This will provide a detailed log output, which should be helpful to determine which assembly reference is triggering the issue. Then, check the values of the properties that are related to that assembly and the project that references it.

You can also create a binary log by using the `-bl` command-line option, and use MSBuild [structured log viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/) to more easily view the log output. For more information, see [Troubleshoot assembly references](../troubleshoot-assembly-references.md).

Check for the following issues:

- Verify that the referenced assembly exists in the specified search paths.
- Check for any typos or misspellings in the assembly name.
- Ensure that the version of the referenced assembly matches the expected version.
