# MSB8036: The Windows SDK 'version' was not found

This error occurs when the Windows SDK requested by your project could not be found where Visual Studio or MSBuild expects to find it.

## Windows SDK version specified in project

If this is a project you're working with in Visual Studio, the first thing to check is that the project targets the correct version of the Windows SDK. Right-click on the project node, and choose **Properties** or press **Alt**+**Enter**. The Property Pages dialog for your project appears. Under **Configuration Properties** > **General**, look for **Windows SDK Version**. For example, it might be **10 (latest installed version)**, which selects the most recent version if more than one version is installed. If you select the dropdown, you can see specific versions that Visual Studio has detected. Make sure that the version your project needs is selected.

If you're using MSBuild directly, not with Visual Studio, you should check the places where the `WindowsTargetPlatformVersion` property might be set. It's usually in the project file, but it could also be in an imported file or in a global settings file such as *Directory.build.props*, which can be located anywhere in the parent path to your project, up to the root of the drive. The default setting in a newly created project file looks like this:

```xml
<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>10.0</WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>
```

Also, check build scripts or CI jobs that invoke MSBuild to make sure that the command line is not passing an invalid value for this property.

## Install or reinstall the Windows SDK

If that doesn't resolve the issue, install or reinstall the Windows SDK version your project needs. You can install specific versions of the Windows SDK by using the Visual Studio Installer. Select the version in **Individual Components**. You can also download the Windows SDK from the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/).
