## Message text

```output
MSB3248: Parameter 'value' has invalid value 'value'.
```

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Remarks

The error code MSB3248 is generated in MSBuild when there is an issue with the parameters specified for resolving assembly references. Below is a detailed analysis of the contexts where this error can occur, potential causes, and suggested resolutions or workarounds.

### Context 1: Invalid or Missing Required Parameter

#### **Context**
This error is triggered when a required parameter for the `ResolveAssemblyReference` task is missing, invalid, or improperly formatted. The task expects specific inputs to function correctly, such as assembly names, paths, or search criteria. If any of these inputs are malformed or not provided, the error is logged.

#### **Possible Cause**
- A parameter that the task relies on was not set in the project file or build script.
- The parameter value is provided but does not adhere to the expected format, such as an invalid file path or an incorrectly specified wildcard.
- The parameter is null or empty, which can happen if variables in the build script are not resolved properly.

#### **Suggested Resolutions**
1. **Verify Input Parameters**: Ensure that all required parameters for the `ResolveAssemblyReference` task are explicitly provided in the project file or build script.
2. **Validate Parameter Values**: Check that the values for parameters like file paths or assembly names are correctly formatted and point to valid resources.
3. **Use Diagnostic Logging**: Enable verbose or diagnostic logging in MSBuild to identify which parameter is causing the issue.
4. **Default Fallbacks**: If possible, define default values for parameters to prevent them from being null or empty.

### Context 2: Unsupported Parameter Combination

#### **Context**
The error can occur when the task receives a combination of parameters that are incompatible or logically contradictory. `ResolveAssemblyReference` may fail to process these inputs correctly, resulting in this error.

#### **Possible Cause**
- Overlapping or conflicting parameters are specified, leading the task to an ambiguous state.
- A feature or behavior is requested using parameters that are not supported in combination.

#### **Suggested Resolutions**
1. **Review Parameter Documentation**: Cross-check the MSBuild documentation for the `ResolveAssemblyReference` task to understand the allowed parameter combinations.
2. **Simplify Input Configuration**: Avoid complex configurations by only specifying necessary parameters. Eliminate redundant or conflicting inputs.
3. **Test Incrementally**: Introduce parameters gradually to identify which combination causes the issue.

### Context 3: Deprecated or Obsolete Parameters

#### **Context**
The error may also occur if the project file or build script uses parameters that have been deprecated or are no longer supported in the current version of MSBuild.

#### **Possible Cause**
- Older project files or build scripts that have not been updated for compatibility with newer MSBuild versions.
- Lack of awareness about breaking changes introduced in recent versions of the tool.

#### **Suggested Resolutions**
1. **Update Project Files**: Refactor the project files to use the latest supported parameters for the `ResolveAssemblyReference` task.
2. **Check Release Notes**: Refer to the MSBuild release notes or changelog to identify deprecated features and their replacements.
3. **Use Compatibility Tools**: Leverage tools or scripts that can automatically modernize project files to align with the latest MSBuild standards.

### Context 4: Misconfiguration in Build Environment

#### **Context**
This error can also be logged when the build environment is incorrectly set up, such as missing or inaccessible assemblies or misconfigured search paths.

#### **Possible Cause**
- Required assemblies are not present in the specified locations or are inaccessible due to file system permissions.
- Search paths for resolving assemblies are not properly defined or are invalid.
- Platform-specific or runtime-specific requirements are not met during the build process.

#### **Suggested Resolutions**
1. **Verify Assembly Locations**: Check that all referenced assemblies exist in the expected locations and are accessible.
2. **Adjust Search Paths**: Update the project file or build configuration to include valid search paths for resolving assemblies.
3. **Ensure Platform Compatibility**: Confirm that the build environment matches the target runtime or platform requirements.
