# MSB3248 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3248 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

```output
MSB3248: Parameter 'value' has invalid value 'value'.
```

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Remarks

The error code MSB3248 is generated in MSBuild when there is an issue with the parameters specified for resolving assembly references. Below is a detailed analysis of the contexts where this error can occur, potential causes, and suggested resolutions or workarounds.

### Description

This error occurs when the `ResolveAssemblyReference` task in MSBuild encounters a parameter with an invalid value or type. The `ResolveAssemblyReference` task is responsible for resolving assembly references in a project. You don't normally invoke it directly; it is called during the build process.

### Common causes

The most likely cause is an MSBuild property that has an invalid value or some other problem.

## Resolution

Enable detailed logging for your MSBuild process by using the `/v:diag` verbosity flag:

```bash
msbuild MyProject.proj /v:diag
```

This will provide a detailed log output, which should be helpful to determine which assembly reference is triggering the issue. Then, check the values of the properties that are related to that assembly and the project that references it.

You can also create a binary log by using the `-bl` command-line option, and use MSBuild [structured log viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/) to more easily view the log output. For more information, see [Troubleshoot assembly references](../troubleshoot-assembly-references.md).
