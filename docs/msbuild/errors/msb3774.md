# MSB3774

This error occurs when the referenced SDK could not be found.

Check the project file and locate the root Project element, and check its `Sdk` attribute. For .NET projects, this should be `Microsoft.NET.Sdk`.

Check that the SDK is installed correctly, and if so, check with the SDK provider to make sure that you are using the right SDK name to reference the SDK.
