# Tutorial: Create an ASP.NET Core app with Vue in Visual Studio

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

In this article, you learn how to build an ASP.NET Core project to act as an API backend and a Vue project to act as the UI.

Currently, Visual Studio includes ASP.NET Core Single Page Application (SPA) templates that support Angular, React, and Vue. The templates provide a built-in Client App folder in your ASP.NET Core projects that contains the base files and folders of each framework.

You can use the method described in this article to create ASP.NET Core Single Page Applications that:

- Put the client app in a separate project, outside from the ASP.NET Core project
- Create the client project based on the framework CLI installed on your computer

> [!NOTE]
> A simplified, updated template is available starting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5. This template creates two projects in the initial solution and eliminates several configuration steps compared to the previous template. This article describes the project creation process using the new template.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to install the following:

- Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 or later with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload installed. Go to the [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?cid=learn-onpage-download-cta) page to install it for free.
  If you need to install the workload and already have Visual Studio, go to **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features...**, which opens the Visual Studio Installer. Choose the **ASP.NET and web development** workload, then choose **Modify**.
- npm ([https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)), which is included with Node.js 

## Create the frontend app

1. In the Start window (choose **File** > **Start Window** to open), select **Create a new project**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/create-new-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Create a new project":::

1. Search for Vue in the search bar at the top and then select **Vue and ASP.NET Core (Preview)** with either JavaScript or TypeScript as the selected language.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/vue-choose-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing choosing a template":::

1. Give your project and solution a name and then choose **Create**.

   Once the project is created, Solution Explorer should look like this:

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/asp-net-core-with-vue-solution-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Solution Explorer":::

   Compared to the [standalone Vue template](../javascript/tutorial-create-vue-app.md), you see some new and modified files for integration with ASP.NET Core:

   - aspnetcore-https.js
   - vite.config.json (modified)
   - HelloWorld.vue (modified)
   - package.json (modified)

## Set the project properties

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the ASP.NET Core project (webapi) and choose **Properties**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/asp-net-core-project-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Open project properties"::: 

1. In the Properties page, open the **Debug** tab and select **Open debug launch profiles UI** option. Clear the **Launch browser** option.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/asp-net-core-deselect-launch-browser.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Debug launch profiles UI"::: 

   This prevents opening the web page with the source weather data.

   >[!NOTE]
   > In Visual Studio, *launch.json* stores the startup settings associated with the **Start** button in the Debug toolbar. Currently, *launch.json* must be located under the *.vscode* folder.

## Start the project

To start the project, press **F5** or select the **Start** button at the top of the window. You will see two command prompts appear:

- The ASP.NET Core API project running
- The Vue CLI running the vue-cli-service serve command

>[!NOTE]
> Check console output for messages, such as a message instructing you to update your version of Node.js.

You should see the Vue app appear, that is populated via the API. If you don't see the app, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Publish the project

Starting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3, you can publish the integrated solution using the Visual Studio Publish tool.

>[!NOTE]
> To use publish, create your JavaScript project using Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3 or later.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the ASP.NET Core project and choose **Add** > **Project Reference**.

1. Select the Vue project and choose **OK**.

1. Right-click the ASP.NET Core project in Solution Explorer and choose **Unload project**.

   This opens the *.csproj* file for the project.

1. In the *.csproj* file, update the project reference and add `<ReferenceOutputAssembly>` with the value set to `false`.

   When you've updated the reference, it should look like this (substituting your own project folder and project name).

   ```xml
   <ProjectReference Include="..\vueprojectfolder\vueprojectname.esproj">
       <ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>
   </ProjectReference>
   ```

1. Right-click the ASP.NET Core project and choose **Reload Project**.

1. In *Program.cs*, update the check for `Environment.IsDevelopment` so it looks like the following.

   ```csharp
   // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
   if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
   {
      app.UseSwagger();
      app.UseSwaggerUI();
   }
   else
   {
      app.UseDefaultFiles();
      app.UseStaticFiles();
   }
   ```

1. To publish, right click the ASP.NET Core project, choose **Publish**, and select options to match your desired publish scenario, such as Azure, publish to a folder, et al.

   The publish process takes more time than it does for just an ASP.NET Core project, since the `npm run build` command gets invoked when publishing.

   You can modify the `npm run build` command using the **Production Build Command** in the Vue project properties. To modify it, right-click the Vue project in Solution Explorer and choose **Properties**.

## Troubleshooting

### Proxy error

You may see the following error:

```
[HPM] Error occurred while trying to proxy request /weatherforecast from localhost:4200 to https://localhost:5173 (ECONNREFUSED) (https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors)
```

If you see this issue, most likely the frontend started before the backend. Once you see the backend command prompt up and running, just refresh the Vue app in the browser.

Otherwise, if the port is in use, try incrementing the port number by **1** in *launchSettings.json* and *vite.config.js*.

### Privacy error

You may see the following certificate error:

```
Your connection isn't private
```

Try deleting the Vue certificates from *%appdata%\local\asp.net\https* or *%appdata%\roaming\asp.net\https*, and then retry.

### Verify ports

If the weather data does not load correctly, you may also need to verify that your ports are correct.

1. Make sure that the port numbers match. Go to the *launchSettings.json* file in your ASP.NET Core project (in the *Properties* folder). Get the port number from the `url` or `applicationUrl` property.

   If there are multiple `url` or `applicationUrl` properties, look for one using an `https` endpoint. It should look similar to `https://localhost:5173`.

1. Then, go to the *vite.config.js* file for your Vue project. Update the url or target property to match the `url` or `applicationUrl` property in *launchSettings.json*. When you update it, that value should look similar to this:

   ```js
   url: 'https://localhost:5173',
   ```

   or:

### Outdated version of Vue

If you see the console message **Could not find the file 'C:\Users\Me\source\repos\vueprojectname\package.json'** when you create the project, you may need to update your version of the Vite CLI. After you update the Vite CLI, you may also need to delete the *.vuerc* file in *C:\Users\\[yourprofilename\]*.

### Docker

If you enable Docker support while creating the web API project, the backend may start up using the Docker profile and not listen on the configured port 5173. To resolve:

Edit the Docker profile in the *launchSettings.json* by adding the following properties:

```json
"httpPort": 5175, 
"sslPort": 5173  
```

Alternatively, reset using the following method:

1. In the Solution properties, set your backend app as the startup project.
1. In the Debug menu, switch the profile using the **Start** button drop-down menu to the profile for your backend app.
1. Next, in the Solution properties, reset to multiple startup projects.

## Next steps

For more information about SPA applications in ASP.NET Core, see [Developing Single Page Apps](/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/intro#developing-single-page-apps). The linked article provides additional context for project files such as *aspnetcore-https.js*, although details of the implementation are different due to differences between the project templates and the Vue.js framework vs. other frameworks. For example, instead of a ClientApp folder, the Vue files are contained in a separate project.
