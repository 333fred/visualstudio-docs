With Visual Studio, you'll always get the best-in-class tools and services available for any developer, any app, and any platform. Whether you're using Visual Studio for the first time or you've been using it for years, there's a lot to like in our newest version, currently in Preview.

## Visual Studio 2022 is 64-bit

Visual Studio 2022 on Windows is now a 64-bit application. This means you can open, edit, run, and debug even the biggest and most complex solutions without running out of memory. To learn more, see the [**Visual Studio 2022 vision**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022/) blog post.

## IntelliCode includes whole line completion

In Visual Studio 2022, the [IntelliCode](/visualstudio/intellicode/) feature can now automatically complete code up to a whole line at a time. For details, see the [**Type less, code more with IntelliCode completions**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/type-less-code-more-with-intellicode-completions/) blog post.

## Build modern apps with .NET and C++

[Visual Studio 2022 Preview 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-preview-2-is-out/) includes better cross-platform app development tools and the latest version of C++ build tools. As well, we're updating **Hot Reload** so that you can edit either C++ or .NET projects while your application is running. For more information, see the [**Speed up your .NET and C++ development with Hot Reload in Visual Studio 2022**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/speed-up-your-dotnet-and-cplusplus-development-with-hot-reload-in-visual-studio-2022/) blog post.

And, new in [Visual Studio 2022 Preview 4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-preview-4-is-now-available/), thereâ€™s a big update for the Blazor and Razor editors, and new capabilities for **Hot Reload** in ASP.NET Core&mdash;including **Hot Reload** when you save a file or when you apply changes to CSS files live!

## Multi-repo support with Git in the IDE

If you've worked with projects hosted on different Git repositories, you might have used external tools or multiple instances of Visual Studio to connect to them. Starting with [Visual Studio 2022 Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-preview-3-now-available/), you can work with a single solution that has projects in multiple repositories and contribute to them all from a single instance of Visual Studio. To learn more, see the [**Multi-repo support in Visual Studio**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/multi-repo-support-in-visual-studio/) blog post.

## Personalization improvements

One of our key focus areas is to make Visual Studio more personalized and flexible so that you can make the IDE your own. For example, [Visual Studio 2022 Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-preview-3-now-available/) offers you the ability to sync with your Windows theme. So, if you've enabled the "night light" feature there, Visual Studio uses it, too. For more info, see the [**Personalize your Visual Studio 2022**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/personalize-your-visual-studio-2022/) blog post.
