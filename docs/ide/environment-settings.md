# Environment settings for Visual Studio

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

When you first open Visual Studio, you can optimize your development environment for the type of development work you do by using the **Import and Export Settings Wizard**. From this wizard, you can choose a specific collection of settings. Each collection of settings optimizes elements such as keyboard shortcuts, window layouts, project and item templates, and command visibility.

The following settings collections are available:

- General
- JavaScript
- Visual Basic
- Visual C#
- Visual C++
- Web Development
- Web Development (Code Only)

## Import and export settings

To open the wizard, select **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings** from the Visual Studio menu bar.

From the wizard, you can export your own settings or import settings that you've previously saved or received from someone else. You can also reset all settings and then choose a predefined settings collection from Visual Studio.

### Reset all settings

1. In the **Import and Export Settings Wizard**, select **Reset all settings**, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Save Current Settings** page, select either **Yes, save my current settings** or **No, just reset settings, overwriting my current settings**, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Choose a Default Collection of Settings** page, select a collection, and then select **Finish**.
