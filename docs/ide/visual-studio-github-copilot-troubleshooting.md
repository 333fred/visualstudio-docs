# Troubleshooting GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio 2022 (Version 17.10 or Higher)
If you encounter the message **“Copilot is temporarily unreachable”** indicating that GitHub Copilot is offline, it could be due to one of the following reasons:

## Network issues
This usually means that your network might be down.
 >Action: Ensure you have a stable internet connection. For more information, refer to the - Troubleshooting network errors for [GitHub Copilot - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/troubleshooting-github-copilot/troubleshooting-network-errors-for-github-copilot)

## Copilot service is unavailable
Sometimes, the Copilot service itself might be down.
>Action: In this case, please wait. The service will be back shortly. You can check the status of the service on the [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/).

## 3. **Refresh your credentials**
Due to the expected timeout you will need to occasionally refresh your credentials. 
>Action: you can do this by clicking the Copilot badge on the top right corner of your Visual Studio and selecting refresh your credentials -> click “refresh your credentials” 

## 4. **Copilot is disabled contact your admin**
 Copilot for individual or any other skew of copilot can be disabled by your administrator on 17.10. 
**Action:** contact your IT department to learn more if you see this state for your copilot badge on the top right of your Visual Studio.
