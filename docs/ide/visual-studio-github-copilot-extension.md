# What is the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio?

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

[**GitHub Copilot**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilotvs) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://aka.ms/VSXGHCopilot) extensions in Visual Studio enable enhanced [AI-assisted development in Visual Studio](ai-assisted-development-visual-studio.md), helping you be more productive and efficient when writing code.

In this article, you'll learn about the Copilot extension, an AI-powered pair programmer extension for Visual Studio that provides you with context-aware code completions, suggestions, and even entire code snippets. This powerful tool aids [AI-assisted development in Visual Studio] and helps developers write code more efficiently, reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks, and minimize errors.

For more information on the GitHub Copilot Chat extension in Visual Studio, see [About the GitHub Copilot Chat extension for Visual Studio](visual-studio-github-copilot-chat.md).

## How GitHub Copilot works

GitHub Copilot works by utilizing advanced machine learning models trained on a vast dataset of publicly available code from GitHub repositories. As you type code, the AI analyzes the context and provides relevant suggestions in real-time. You can receive suggestions also by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.
