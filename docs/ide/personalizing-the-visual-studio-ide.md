# Customize the Visual Studio IDE

You can customize Visual Studio IDE settings in various ways to best support your own development style and requirements. Many of your settings roam with you across Visual Studio instances&mdash;see [Synchronized settings](../ide/synchronized-settings-in-visual-studio.md). This article briefly describes different personalizations and where you can find more information.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies to Visual Studio on Windows. For Visual Studio for Mac, see [Customize the Visual Studio for Mac IDE](/visualstudio/mac/customizing-the-ide).

## Default environment settings for Visual Studio

You can choose a default collection of [environment settings](environment-settings.md) that optimizes Visual Studio for your type of development. 

In Visual Studio, you can optimize your development environment for the type of development work you do by selecting **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings Wizard**. From this wizard, you can choose a specific collection of settings that best matches your development environment. Each collection of settings optimizes elements such as keyboard shortcuts, window layouts, project and item templates, and command visibility.

## General environment options

Many personalization options are exposed through the [Environment Options](../ide/reference/general-environment-options-dialog-box.md) dialog box. There are two ways to access this dialog box:

- On the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options**, and if it's not already expanded, expand the **Environment** node.

- Press **Ctrl**+**Q**, type **environment** in the search box, and then choose **Environment > General** from the results.

> [!TIP]
> When the Options dialog box appears, you can press **F1** for help on the various settings on that page.

## Environment color themes

To change the color theme between Dark, Light, Blue, and Blue (Extra Contrast), type **theme** in the search box, and then choose **Environment > General**. In the **Options** dialog box, change the **Color theme** option.

To change colorization options in the editor, type **environment** in the search box, and then choose **Environment > Fonts and Colors**. See [How to: Change fonts and colors](../ide/how-to-change-fonts-and-colors-in-visual-studio.md).

## Customize menus and toolbars

To add or remove menu or toolbar items, see [How to: Customize menus and toolbars](../ide/how-to-customize-menus-and-toolbars-in-visual-studio.md).

### Main menu casing

You can change the main menu casing between **Title Case** ("File") and **All Caps** ("FILE"). Type **environment** in the search box, select **Environment > General**, and then change the **Apply title case styling to menu bar** option.

## Window layouts

You can define and save multiple window layouts and switch between them. For example, you can define one layout for coding and one for debugging. To arrange window positions and behavior and save custom layouts, see [Customize window layouts and personalize tabs](../ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio.md).

## External tools

You can customize the **Tools** menu to launch external tools. For more information, see [Manage external tools](../ide/managing-external-tools.md).
