# Side-by-side comparison of Git and Team Explorer

We launched the first version of a new Git experience in Visual Studio 2019 [version 16.8](/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes/). The new experience aims to reduce context switching by providing a simple **Git Changes** window that includes common Git tasks. It also provides a screen-wide **Git Repository** window for more advanced Git operations, such as branch management and repository browsing.

If youâ€™ve been using Team Explorer, here is a step-by-step guide that explains how you can use the new Git experience instead.
