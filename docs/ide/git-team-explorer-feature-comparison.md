# Side-by-side comparison of Git and Team Explorer

We launched the first version of a new Git experience in Visual Studio 2019 [version 16.8](/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes/). This new experience helps reduce context switching by providing a simple **Git Changes** window that includes common Git tasks. It also provides a screen-wide **Git Repository** window for more advanced Git operations, such as branch management and repository browsing.

If youâ€™ve been using Team Explorer, here is a step-by-step guide that explains how you can use the new Git experience instead.

## Get started

|Features  |Team Explorer  |The new Git experience |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Clone a repo     | :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2019/clone-repo-team-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'clone a repo' window for Team Explorer in Visual Studio 2019, with a procedure overlay.":::  </p>1. Open the **Connect** page. <br> 2. Expand **Manage Connections**. <br> 3. Select **Connect to Project**.      | :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2019/clone-repo-new-git.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'clone a repo' window for Git in Visual Studio 2019, with a procedure overlay.":::  </p> 1.

|Switch between repos     |         |         |
|Open a solution     |         |         |
|Add a solution to source control <br>and create a new repository     |         |         |
> [!NOTE]
> The New Git Experience should automatically connect to the correct Azure DevOps repository based on the repository or solution you opened. If for some reason you need to manually connect to the repo, you can still do that by using Team Explorer. From the Visual Studio menu bar, select **View** > **Team Explorer** > **Manage Connections** > **Connect**.
