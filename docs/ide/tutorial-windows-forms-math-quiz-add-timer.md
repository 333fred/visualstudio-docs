# Tutorial: Add a timer control to a math quiz Windows Forms app in Visual Studio

In this series of four tutorials, you'll build a math quiz. The quiz contains four random math problems that a quiz taker tries to answer within a specified time.

The Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) provides the tools that you need to create the app. To learn more about this IDE, see [Welcome to the Visual Studio IDE](../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md).

The quiz uses a timer control. The code behind this control tracks the time that has elapsed and checks the quiz taker's answers.

In this third tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Add a Timer control.
> - Add an event handler for the timer.
> - Write code to check the user's answers, display messages, and fill in the correct answers.
