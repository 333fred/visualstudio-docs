# Tutorial: Add code to a math quiz Windows Forms app in Visual Studio

In this series of four tutorials, you'll build a math quiz. The quiz contains four random math problems that a quiz taker tries to answer within a specified time.

The Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) provides the tools that you need to create the app. To learn more about this IDE, see [Welcome to the Visual Studio IDE](../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md).

Controls use C# or Visual Basic code.

In this second tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Write code to create Random objects to use in math problems.
> - Add an event handler for the start button.
> - Write code to start the quiz.
