# Customize startup

You can customize the startup experience for Visual Studio in several different ways, such as opening your most recent solution or just an empty development environment.

## To change the startup item

2. Expand **Environment**, and then select **Startup**.

3. In the **On startup, open** list, select what you want to happen after Visual Studio launches. You can choose from **Start window** (which lets you open a new or existing project), **Most recent solution**, or **Empty environment**.
