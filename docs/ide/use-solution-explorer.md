# How to use Solution Explorer

You can use the Solution Explorer tool window to create & manage your solutions and projects and to view & interact with your code. In this article, we'll detail the user interface (UI) options that help you do so.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies only to Visual Studio on Windows.

## The Solution Explorer tool window

To start, let's take a look at the Solution Explorer tool window in the [Visual Studio IDE](../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md), where we've opened a [C# Calculator solution](..//get-started/csharp/tutorial-console.md?view=vs-2019#code-complete).

Your Solution Explorer tool window might look different than what you see here. For example, if you choose to open a local folder or repository instead of a specific project or solution, you'll see a **Folder View**, where your solution and project information appears in folders.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the Solution Explorer tool window, open it from the Visual Studio menu bar by using **View** > **Solution Explorer**, or by pressing **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**L**.

## The Solution Explorer menu bar

Next, let's take a look at the Solution Explorer menu bar.

The menu bar contains the following UI (user interface) elements, from left to right:

- **Back** button, to help you
- **Forward** button, to help you
- **Home** button, to ...
- **Switch** button, to switch between available views, such as **Folder View** and the default view, and to view a repository that contains multiple solutions.
- **Pending Changes Filter** button, which includes a drop-down menu where you can ... This is useful when ...
- **Sync with Active Document** button, to ...
- **Collapse All** button, to ...
- **Show All Files** button, to ...
- **Properties** button, to ...
- **Preview Selected Items** button, to ...

## The Solution Explorer right-click context menu

When you're managing your files in Solution Explorer, there are several features that you can access by using the right-click context menu. Most of these features are available universally in the [Visual Studio IDE](../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md), while some are specific to the programming language or platform you're using.

Here, we'll cover the context menu items that appear in a simple [C# Calculator solution](..//get-started/csharp/tutorial-console.md?view=vs-2019#code-complete).
