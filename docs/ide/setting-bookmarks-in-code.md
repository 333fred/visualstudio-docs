# Set bookmarks in code

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

You can use bookmarks to mark lines in your code so that you can quickly return to a specific location, or jump back and forth between locations. Bookmark commands and icons are available in two places: the **Bookmark Window** (**View** > **Bookmark Window**) and the text editor toolbar.

## Add bookmarks

Here's how to add a bookmark:

1. Place the cursor on the line you want to bookmark. 
1. Select the **Toggle a bookmark** button, or press **Ctrl**+**K**, **Ctrl**+**K**. 

After you follow these steps, Visual Studio adds the bookmark. If you select the **Toggle a bookmark** button (or press **Ctrl**+**K**, **Ctrl**+**K**) again, the bookmark is removed.

## Rename bookmarks

You can rename a bookmark in the **Bookmark Window** by using the right-click or context menu. 

## Disable or delete bookmarks

You can delete bookmarks by selecting the **Delete** button in the bookmark window.

You can turn off bookmarks (without removing them) by selecting the **Disable All Bookmarks** button in the bookmark window. You can re-enable them by selecting the same button (which is now called **Enable All Bookmarks**).

## Navigate and organize bookmarks
You can navigate between bookmarks by using the **Next bookmark** and **Previous bookmark** buttons in the bookmark window.

You can organize bookmarks into virtual folders by selecting **New Folder** in the bookmark window and then dragging selected bookmarks into the new folder.
