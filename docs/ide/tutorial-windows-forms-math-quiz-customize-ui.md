# Tutorial: Customize a math quiz Windows Forms app in Visual Studio

In this series of four tutorials, you'll build a math quiz. The quiz contains four random math problems that a quiz taker tries to answer within a specified time.

The Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) provides the tools that you need to create the app. To learn more about this IDE, see [Welcome to the Visual Studio IDE](../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md).

This tutorial shows you how to enhance your quiz by clearing default values and by customizing the appearance of controls.
