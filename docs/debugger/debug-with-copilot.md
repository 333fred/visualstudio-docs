# Debug your app with Copilot

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

The private preview of GitHub Copilot chat for Visual Studio 2022 supports many interactive debugging scenarios, including AI-assisted chat for debugging questions related to your variables, the call stack, and other code elements, along with highly targeted help associated with an **Ask Copilot** link.

For related videos, see the [blog post announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/simplified-code-refinement-and-debugging-with-github-copilot-chat/
).

## Prerequisites

To use the private preview of Copilot with the debugging features, you must have Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.4 or later, a GitHub Copilot subscription, and the Copilot extensions for Visual Studio installed.

For detailed information and installation instructions, see [Prerequisites & supported programming languages](../ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-extension.md#prerequisites--supported-programming-languages).

## AI-assisted auto insights

Copilot provides detailed information in the CPU Usage auto insights. It provides detailed information and insights for specific methods and properties, such as `String.Concat` and many other methods. With Copilot, ask questions about functions on the identified hot paths in your code, which can help you produce more efficient or cost-effective code.

When the CPU Usage tool provides auto insights in the Top Insights section, select **Ask Copilot** to learn from Copilot and start asking questions.

## AI-assisted exceptions

Copilot has access to exceptions, call stack, local variables, and code. By asking good questions based on the relevant exception data that Visual Studio has when youâ€™re at an exception, Copilot Chat can provide useful insights and fixes for the issue.

When you see an exception, select the **Ask Copilot** link to get AI-generated answers related to the specific exception and context.

If you have more questions, just ask Copilot!

## AI-assisted debugging

Copilot understands call stacks, frames, variable names, and values. As a result, you can pose detailed questions to the debugger-aware Copilot.
