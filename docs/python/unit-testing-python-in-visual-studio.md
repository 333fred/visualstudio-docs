# Write unit tests for Python with Test Explorer in Visual Studio

Unit tests are pieces of code that test other code units in an application, typically isolated functions, classes, and so on. When an application passes all its unit tests, you can be confident that at least the low-level program functionality is correct.

Python uses unit tests extensively to validate scenarios while designing a program. Python support in Visual Studio includes discovering, executing, and debugging unit tests within the context of your development process, without needing to run tests separately.

This article provides a brief outline of unit testing capabilities in Visual Studio with Python. For more on unit testing in general, see [Unit test your code](../test/unit-test-your-code.md).
