> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to classic Azure Cloud Services, which is a legacy technology designed in the early years of Azure cloud development. Existing services built with this technology are still supported through [Cloud Services (extended support)](../cloud-services-extended-support.md). For new development, we recommend that you use a newer service type designed for your specific purpose, such as [Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/overview), [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp), or [Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/overview). For the latest list of available services, see [Directory of Azure products](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/).
