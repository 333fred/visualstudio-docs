# Upgrade from MSTestV1 to MSTestV2

## How to upgrade

Upgrade your test project by retargeting the MSTest version referenced in you csproj from the MSTestV1 to MSTestV2. Not all features in MSTestV1 were brought forward into MSTestV2 so some changes may be required to resolve errors. See [MSTestV1 features that are not supported in MSTestV2](#MSTestV1-features-that-are-not-supported-in-MSTestV2) to understand what features will no longer resolve and may need to be removed from your tests.

### Old style csproj example

Before targeting MSTestV1:
```xml
    <Reference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework, Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a, processorArchitecture=MSIL">
      <Private>False</Private>
    </Reference>
```

After targeting MSTestV2:
```xml
    <Reference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.TestFramework, Version=14.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a, processorArchitecture=MSIL">
      <HintPath>..\packages\MSTest.TestFramework.2.1.2\lib\net45\Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.TestFramework.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Test projects that are Coded UI tests or Web Load Tests are not compatible with MSTestV2. These project types have been deprecated. Read more on [Coded UI Test deprecation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/changes-to-coded-ui-test-in-visual-studio-2019/) and [Web Load Test deprecation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/cloud-based-load-testing-service-eol/).

### SDK-style csproj (.NET Core and .NET 5)

If your csproj is the newer sdk-style csproj you are most likely already using MSTestV2. The NuGet package for MSTestV2 can be found [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MSTest.TestFramework).

Example:
```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="16.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="MSTest.TestAdapter" Version="2.1.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="MSTest.TestFramework" Version="2.1.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="coverlet.collector" Version="1.3.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

```

## Why Upgrade to MSTestV2?

In 2016 we released the next step in evolving the MSTest framework with MSTestV2. You can read more about this change in the announcement [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/taking-the-mstest-framework-forward-with-mstest-v2/).

1. MSTestV2 is more easily acquired and updated because it is delivered as a [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MSTest.TestFramework/)
2. MSTestV2 is [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/testfx).
3. Uniform app-platform support â€“ this is a converged implementation that offers uniform app-platform support across .NET Framework, .NET Core and ASP.NET Core, and UWP [Read more](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2016/09/01/announcing-mstest-v2-framework-support-for-net-core-1-0-rtm/).
4. The implementation is fully cross platform (Windows, Linux, Mac) [Read more](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/04/05/mstest-v2-is-open-source/).
5. MSTestV2 supports targeting .NET Framework 4.5.0 and later, .NET Core 1.0 and later (Universal Windows Apps 10+, DNX Core 5+), ASP.NET Core 1.0 and later, and .NET 5 and later.
6. Provides a uniform, single end-user extensibility mechanism. [Read more](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/07/18/extending-mstest-v2/).
7. Provides a uniform DataRow support, for all MSTest based test projects [Read more](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/02/25/mstest-v2-now-and-ahead/).
8. Provides the ability to place the TestCategory attribute at the level of a class or assembly [Read more](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/02/25/mstest-v2-now-and-ahead/).
9. Test methods from base classes defined in another assembly are now discovered and run from the derived Test class. This brings in a consistent behavior with derived test class types. If this behavior is not required for compat reasons it can be changed back using the following runsettings:
<RunSettings>    
 <MSTest> 
   <EnableBaseClassTestMethodsFromOtherAssemblies>false</EnableBaseClassTestMethodsFromOtherAssemblies> 
 </MSTest> 
</RunSettings>

10. The TestCleanup method on a TestClass is invoked even if its corresponding TestInitialize method fails. [Issue details](https://github.com/Microsoft/testfx/issues/250).
11. The time taken by AssemblyInitialize and ClassInitialize are not considered as part of a tests duration thereby limiting their impact on a test timing out.
12. Test which are not runnable can be configured to be marked as failed via MapNotRunnableToFailed tag which is part of the adapter node in the runsettings.

```xml
<RunSettings>    
 <MSTest> 
   <MapNotRunnableToFailed>true</MapNotRunnableToFailed> 
 </MSTest> 
</RunSettings>
```

## MSTestV1 features that are not supported in MSTestV2

1.	Tests cannot be included into an "Ordered Test".
2.	The adapter does not support being configured via a .testsettings file. Use the new [runsettings file](../test/configure-unit-tests-by-using-a-dot-runsettings-file.md) for test run configuration.
3.	The adapter does not support test lists specified as a .vsmdi file.
4.	The "Coded UI Test Project", and the "Web Performance and Load Test Project" types are not supported per the deprecation announcements.
5.	Association with a testcase item in TFS is not supported.
