# How to configure and use Live Unit Testing

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

As you're developing an application, Live Unit Testing automatically runs any impacted unit tests in the background and presents the results and code coverage in real time. As you modify your code, Live Unit Testing provides feedback on how your changes impacted existing tests and whether the new code you've added is covered by one or more existing tests. This gently reminds you to write unit tests as you're making bug fixes or adding new features.

> [!NOTE]
> Live Unit Testing is available for C# and Visual Basic projects that target .NET Core or .NET Framework in the Enterprise edition of Visual Studio.

When you use Live Unit Testing for your tests, it persists data about the status of your tests. Using persisted data allows Live Unit Testing to offer superior performance while running your tests dynamically in response to code changes.

## Supported test frameworks

Live Unit Testing works with the three popular unit testing frameworks listed in the following table. The minimum supported version of their adapters and frameworks is also shown. The unit testing frameworks are all available from NuGet.org.

|Test Framework  |Visual Studio Adapter minimum version  |Framework minimum version  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|xUnit.net |xunit.runner.visualstudio version 2.2.0-beta3-build1187 |xunit 1.9.2 |
|NUnit |NUnit3TestAdapter version 3.5.1 |NUnit version 3.5.0 |
|MSTest |MSTest.TestAdapter 1.1.4-preview |MSTest.TestFramework 1.0.5-preview |

If you have older MSTest-based test projects that reference Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework, and you don’t wish to move to the newer MSTest NuGet packages, upgrade to Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2017.

In some cases, you may need to explicitly restore the NuGet packages referenced by a project in order for Live Unit Testing to work. You can do this either by doing an explicit build of the solution (select **Build** > **Rebuild Solution** from the top-level Visual Studio menu) or by restoring packages in the solution (right-click on the solution and select **Restore NuGet Packages**).

## Configure

The first time you start Live Unit Testing for a solution you will be presented with a setup wizard, that lets you configure the way that Live Unit Testing should build and run tests.

> [!TIP]
> When Live Unit Testing is stopped, you can also open the setup wizard by going to **Test > Live Unit Testing > Configure Live Unit Testing for solution**.

When Live Unit Testing runs it creates a workspace, which is a copy of the original repository. Live Unit Testing then applies any unsaved changes that you made in Visual Studio to the workspace, performs a build, a test run and reports on the latest code coverage.
The first thing that you should configure using the wizard is where the files should be copied from and where they should be copied to.

![Live Unit Testing configuration wizard page 1](./media/lut-v2/Configure-LUT-Wizard-1.png)

### Repository root
This specifies the folder which will be copied to create the Live Unit Testing workspace. It should be the root folder of the repository, i.e. contain all sources, binaries, tools.
In cases where the solution file is not present under the repository root, the repository root might need to be changed. 

### Worskpace root
This specifies the folder where Live Unit Testing keeps a clone of the repository.
Watch out for path too long exceptions. By default, this is created under your home folder, however if for example you normally need to create your repository under the C:\ drive, the workspace root could be adjusted to something like C:\lut\Repo.

### Specify the excluded files
Not all the files should be copied to the Live Unit Testing workspace. Any artifacts that are generated during the build should be excluded from the copying, so that the regular builds do not interfere with the Live Unit Testing builds and the regular nuget restore does not interfere with the Live Unit Testing nuget restore.

By default, Live Unit Testing excludes one of the two patterns of files:
1. For git repositories, files specified in the gitignore are not copied to the Live Unit Testing workspace.
2. For non-git repositories, a basic list of folders, such as bin/ obj/ are not copied to the Live Unit Testing workspace.

For more complex repositories you might need to specify your own ignore file. You can do this by selecting the “<Custom>” option from the wizard. Then, when you click next you should be shown the content of a custom ignore file that Live Unit Testing will create once you finish the wizard (the lutignore file).

> [!NOTE]
> A custom lutignore file is needed for some git repositories, as it is possible to check in files into the git repository that are also ignored by the gitignore file. Without a custom lutignore file Live Unit Testing will not copy these files and that might lead to build failures.

#### *Lutignore file structure*

The lutignore file uses the same format as a [gitignore file]. It should contain rules that match folders/files generated during the build, so that they’re not copied into the workspace. 
For most of the default project templates the following ignore file would be sufficient:

```
[BB]IN
[OO]BJ
# WILL NOT COPY ANY BIN AND OBJ FOLDERS TO THE LIVE UNIT TESTING WORKSPACE
```

If your repository has a single build folder, the ignore file should list that folder instead:

```
[AA]RTIFACTS/
# WILL NOT COPY THE ARTIFACTS FOLDER TO THE LIVE UNIT TESTING WORKSPACE
```

If your repository includes some additional tools in the build folder, these should be then excludes in the set of matching patterns:

```
[AA]RTIFACTS/
![AA]RTIFACTS/TOOLS/
# WILL NOT COPY THE ARTIFACTS FOLDER TO THE LIVE UNIT TESTING WORKSPACE
# HOWEVER IT WILL COPY THE TOOLS SUBFOLDER THAT MIGHT CONTAIN TOOLS AND UTILITIES
```

### Build options

The second part of the wizard configuration page is to configure the build options.
1. Generate PDBs – to speed up the build Live Unit Testing does not generate PDBs during builds. These are symbol files and allow you to navigate to the stack traces when test failures occur. 
2. Build using multiple CPU cores – by default Live Unit Testing will perform builds using multiple CPU cores. This significantly improves the build times. If that slows down your machine or if your solution fails to be built using multiple processors, then this option should be deselected.

### Test run options

The last part of the wizard configuration page is to setup the test run options.
1. Test case timeout – some of the tests might take a long time to run. Setting this field will automatically abort runs if any of the tests exceeds a given time duration. Note that the tests can be automatically cancelled.
2. Use multiple processors – by default Live Unit Testing will try to use multiple processors to speed up the run performance. If that slows down your machine or if your solution cannot run tests in parallel then this option should be deselected. This could happen if for instance multiple tests try to write/read from the same file paths.

### More configuration

Configure Live Unit Testing by selecting **Tools** > **Options** from the top-level Visual Studio menu bar, and then selecting **Live Unit Testing** in the left pane of the **Options** dialog.

> [!TIP]
> After Live Unit Testing is enabled (see the next section, [Start, pause, and stop Live Unit Testing](#start-pause-and-stop)), you can also open the **Options** dialog by selecting **Test** > **Live Unit Testing** > **Options**.

The following image shows the Live Unit Testing configuration options available in the dialog:

![Live Unit Testing configuration options](./media/lut-v2/Tools-Options-LUT.png)

The configurable options include:

- Whether Live Unit Testing pauses when a solution is built and debugged.

- Whether Live Unit Testing pauses when a system's battery power falls below a specified threshold.

- The ability to delete all persisted data. This is useful when Live Unit Testing is behaving in an unpredictable or unexpected way, which suggests that the persisted data has become corrupted.

- The maximum amount of memory that Live Unit Testing processes can consume.

- The level of information written to the Live Unit Testing **Output** window.

   Options include no logging (**None**), error messages only (**Error**), error and informational messages (**Info**, the default), or all detail (**Verbose**).

   You can also display verbose output in the Live Unit Testing **Output** window by assigning a value of "1" to a user-level environment variable named `VS_UTE_DIAGNOSTICS`, and then restarting Visual Studio.

   To capture detailed MSBuild log messages from Live Unit Testing in a file, set the `LiveUnitTesting_BuildLog` user-level environment variable to the name of the file to contain the log.

## Customize your build for Live Unit Testing

For more complex solutions it might be necessary to further customize the build. For example, it might not be necessary to build translation files during test runs and in order to speed up your builds you can disable their build with Live Unit Testing. You can do that by manipulating the project files.
### Add Live Unit Testing overrides
// TODO //

If your solution requires custom steps to build for instrumentation (Live Unit Testing) that are not required for the "regular" non-instrumented build, then you can add code to your project or .targets files that checks for the BuildingForLiveUnitTesting property and performs custom pre/post build steps. You can also choose to remove certain build steps (like publishing or generating packages) or to add build steps (like copying prerequisites) to a Live Unit Testing build based on this project property. Customizing your build based on this property does not alter your regular build in any way, and only impacts Live Unit Testing builds.

For example, there may be a target that produces NuGet packages during a regular build. You probably do not want NuGet packages to be generated after every edit you make. So you can disable that target in the Live Unit Testing build by doing something like the following:

### Live Unit Testing Test dependencies

It’s possible that not all of the files were copied that are required for the tests to run. Live Unit Testing creates a separate folder where it runs tests.
That allows builds to occur, while the tests are running, but not all files from the build folder are copied to the test folder.
Typically you will add the test dependencies for one of two reasons:
1. Your tests depend on files under the source tree (for instance the tests examine the contents of the resx files, or maybe read some config files).
2. Your tests depend on some libraries they reference. For instance, a test runs an executable that’s built as a dependency.

> [!Note]
> Test dependencies must exist within the directory specified as `Repository Root` in the Configuration Wizard.

In both cases Live Unit Testing by default will not copy these files in order to minimize the amount of files that have to be copied in order to run a test. You need to explicitly specify these files using the LiveUnitTestingTestDependency property if they are needed for a test run.
For example, let’s say that we have the following layout:

```
SRC/
  CONSOLE_UTILITY/
  TEST_PROJECT/
ARTIFACTS/
  CONSOLE_UTILITY/NET472/DEBUG/
  TEST_PROJECT/NET472/DEBUG/
```

By default when you build these projects with Live Unit Testing, it will only copy `Artifacts/Test_Project` to the test folder. To add sources or the console_utility to the test folder you should add the following to the test_project.csproj:

```
<LiveUnitTestingTestDependency Include=”$(RepoRoot)/Src/ConsoleUtility” />
<LiveUnitTestingTestDependency Include=”$(RepoRoot)/Artifacts/ConsoleUtility/net472/$(Configuration)/</LiveUnitTestingTestDependency” />
```

## Start, pause, and stop

To enable Live Unit Testing, select **Test** > **Live Unit Testing** > **Start** from the top-level Visual Studio menu. When Live Unit Testing is enabled, the options available on the **Live Unit Testing** menu change from a single item, **Start**, to **Pause** and **Stop**:

- **Pause** temporarily suspends Live Unit Testing.

  When Live Unit Testing is paused, coverage visualization does not appear in the editor, but all the data that was collected is preserved. To resume Live Unit Testing, select **Continue** from the Live Unit Testing menu. Live Unit Testing does the necessary work to catch up with all the edits that have been made while it was paused and updates the glyphs appropriately.

- **Stop** completely stops Live Unit Testing. Live Unit Testing discards all data that it has collected.

> [!NOTE]
> If you start Live Unit Testing in a solution that does not include a unit test project, the **Pause** and **Stop** options appear on the **Live Unit Testing** menu, but Live Unit Testing does not start. The **Output** window displays a message that begins, "No supported test adapters are referenced by this solution...".

At any time, you can temporarily pause or completely stop Live Unit Testing. You may want to do this, for example, if you're in the middle of a refactoring and know that your tests will be broken for a while.

## View coverage visualization

After it's enabled, Live Unit Testing updates each line of code in the Visual Studio editor to show you whether the code you're writing is covered by unit tests and whether the tests that cover it are passing. The following image shows lines of code with both passing and failing tests, as well as lines of code that are not covered by tests. Lines decorated with a green "✓" are covered only by passing tests, lines decorated with a red "x" are covered by one or more failing tests, and lines decorated by a blue  "➖" are not covered by any test.

::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Code coverage in Visual Studio](./media/lut-codewindow.png)
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Code coverage in Visual Studio](./media/vs-2022/lut-code-window.png)
::: moniker-end

Live Unit Testing coverage visualization is updated immediately when you modify code in the code editor. While processing the edits, visualization changes to indicate that the data is not up-to-date by adding a round timer image below the passing, failing, and not covered symbols, as the following image shows.

::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Code coverage in Visual Studio with timer icon](./media/lut-codeupdating.png)
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Code coverage in Visual Studio with timer icon](./media/vs-2022/lut-code-updating.png)
::: moniker-end

## Get information about test status

By hovering over the succeeded or failed symbol in the code window, you can see how many tests are hitting that line. To see the status of the individual tests, select the symbol:

::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Test status for a symbol in Visual Studio](./media/lut-failedinfo.png)
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Test status for a symbol in Visual Studio](./media/vs-2022/lut-failed-info.png)
::: moniker-end

In addition to providing the names and result of tests, the tooltip lets you rerun or debug the set of tests. If you select one or more of the tests in the tooltip, you can also run or debug just those tests. This allows you to debug your tests without having to leave the code window. When debugging, in addition to observing any breakpoints you may have already set, program execution pauses when the debugger executes an <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.Assert> method that returns an unexpected result.

When you hover over a failed test in the tooltip, it expands to provide additional info about the failure, as shown in the following image. To navigate directly to a failed test, double-click it in the tooltip.

::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Failed test tooltip info in Visual Studio](./media/lut-failedmsg.png)
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Failed test tooltip info in Visual Studio](./media/vs-2022/lut-failed-message.png)
::: moniker-end

When you navigate to the failed test, Live Unit Testing visually indicates in the method signature the tests that have:

- passed (indicated by a half-full beaker along with a green "✓")
- failed (a half-full beaker along with a red  "🞩")
- are not involved in Live Unit Testing (a half-full beaker along with a blue  "➖")

Non-test methods are not decorated with a symbol. The following image illustrates all four types of methods.

::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Test methods in Visual Studio with pass or fail symbol](media/lut-testsource.png)
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Test methods in Visual Studio with pass or fail symbol](media/vs-2022/lut-test-source.png)
::: moniker-end

## Diagnose and correct test failures

From the failed test, you can easily debug the product code, make edits, and continue developing your application. Because Live Unit Testing runs in the background, you don't have to stop and restart Live Unit Testing during the debug, edit, and continue cycle.

For example, the test failure shown in the previous image was caused by an incorrect assumption in the test method that non-alphabetic characters return `true` when passed to the <xref:System.Char.IsLower%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. After you correct the test method, all the tests should pass. You don't have to pause or stop Live Unit Testing.


::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"
## Live Unit Testing window

**Live Unit Testing**, similar to **Test Explorer**, provides an interface that lets you run and debug tests and analyze test results. When Live Unit Testing is enabled, the status of unit tests in **Test Explorer** is updated immediately. You don't need to explicitly run the unit tests. When Live Unit Testing is not enabled or is stopped, **Live Unit Testing** displays the status of unit tests the last time a test was run. After you restart Live Unit Testing, a source code change is required to rerun the tests.

> [!TIP]
> Start Live Unit Testing by selecting **Test** > **Live Unit Testing** > **Start** from the top-level Visual Studio menu. You can also open the **Live Unit Testing** window using **View** > **Other Windows** > **Live Unit Testing Window**.

You may notice in the **Live Unit Testing** window that some tests are faded out. For example, when you stop and restart Live Unit Testing, the **Live Unit Testing** window fades out all the tests, as the following image shows. Faded-out test results indicate that the test was not a part of the latest Live Unit Test run. Tests only run when a change to the test or the test's dependencies is detected. If there is no change, it avoids unnecessarily running the test. In this case, the grayed out test result is still "up-to-date" though it was not a part of the latest run.
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="vs-2019"

![Faded out tests in Test Explorer](media/vs-2019/lut-test-explorer.png)
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Faded out tests in Test Explorer](media/vs-2022/lut-test-explorer.png)

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"
You can rerun any tests that appear faded by making a code change.

There are some differences between Live Unit Testing automatically running and updating test results and explicitly running tests from **Test Explorer**. These differences include:

- Running or debugging tests from the Test Explorer window runs regular binaries, whereas Live Unit Testing runs instrumented binaries.
- Live Unit Testing does not create a new application domain to run tests, but rather runs tests from the default domain. Tests run from the **Test Explorer** window do create a new application domain.
- Live Unit Testing runs tests in each test assembly sequentially. In the **Test Explorer** window, you can choose to run multiple tests in parallel.

## Large solutions

If your solution has 10 or more projects, Visual Studio displays the following dialog when you:

- start Live Unit Testing and there is no persisted data
- select **Tools** > **Options** > **Live Unit Testing** > **Delete Persisted Data**

![Live Unit Testing dialog for large projects](media/lut-large-project.png)

The dialog warns you that dynamic execution of large numbers of tests in large projects can severely impact performance. If you select **OK**, Live Unit Testing executes all tests in the solution. If you select **Cancel**, you can select the tests to execute. The following section explains how to do this.

## Include and exclude test projects and test methods

Live Unit Testing playlist is a feature working just like playlists in the test explorer. For solutions with many test projects, you can control which projects and individual methods in a project participate in Live Unit Testing by editing the playlist. For example, if you have a solution with hundreds of test projects, you can select a targeted set of test projects to participate in Live Unit Testing. 

There are multiple ways to edit the Live Unit Testing playlist.
//TODO add screenshots //
1. Live Unit Testing tool window
2. The code editor window
3. The solution explorer
4. Programatically in test code.

Live Unit Testing saves include/exclude state as a user setting and remembers it when a solution is closed and reopened.

### Live Unit Testing tool window
// TODO

### The code editor window

You can use the code editor window to include or exclude individual test methods. Right-click on the signature or body of the test method in the code editor window, and then select one of the following options:

- **Live Unit Testing** > **Include \<selected method>**
- **Live Unit Testing** > **Exclude \<selected method>**
- **Live Unit Testing** > **Exclude All But \<selected method>**

### The solution explorer

To select the individual projects in unit tests, do the following after Live Unit Testing is started:

1. Right-click the solution in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Live Unit Testing** > **Exclude** to exclude the entire solution.
1. Right-click each test project that you'd like to include in the tests and choose **Live Unit Testing** > **Include**.

### Programatically in test code.

You can apply the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute> attribute to programmatically exclude methods, classes, or structures from reporting their coverage in Live Unit Testing.

Use the following attributes to exclude individual methods from Live Unit Testing:

- For xUnit: `[Trait("Category", "SkipWhenLiveUnitTesting")]`
- For NUnit: `[Category("SkipWhenLiveUnitTesting")]`
- For MSTest: `[TestCategory("SkipWhenLiveUnitTesting")]`

Use the following attributes to exclude an entire assembly of tests from Live Unit Testing:

- For xUnit: `[assembly: AssemblyTrait("Category", "SkipWhenLiveUnitTesting")]`
- For NUnit: `[assembly: Category("SkipWhenLiveUnitTesting")]`
- For MSTest: `[assembly: TestCategory("SkipWhenLiveUnitTesting")]`

## Cancelling Live Unit Testing test runs

Live Unit Testing keeps running tests whenever you make any code changes.
If a run is in progress and you make more code changes, Live Unit Testing will queue another
run waiting for the first run to complete.

Whenever you save files, Live Unit Testing will instead cancel the first run
and immediately schedule the queued run instead. This helps with scenarios where the
first run would have taken very long to complete.
