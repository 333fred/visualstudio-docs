> [!NOTE]
> In ClickOnce for .NET 3.1 or later, you set deployment properties using the Publish tool instead of the Publish wizard and the Publish page of the Project Designer. For more information, see [Deploy a .NET Windows application using ClickOnce](../../deployment/quickstart-deploy-using-clickonce-folder.md) and [ClickOnce for .NET 3.1](../../deployment/clickonce-deployment-dotnet.md).
