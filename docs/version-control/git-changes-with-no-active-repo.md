# Git Changes window with no active repo set

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

If you issue a Git instruction in Visual Studio, such as trying to commit a change when there's no active repo set, you see the Git Changes window. From this window, you may choose to:

- [Create a repo](git-create-repository.md)
- [Clone a repo](git-clone-repository.md)

If you're new to Git in Visual Studio, see [How Visual Studio makes version control easy with Git](git-with-visual-studio.md).
