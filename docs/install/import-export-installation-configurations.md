# Import or export installation configurations

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

You can use installation configuration files to configure Visual Studio. To do so, export the workloads and components information to a *.vsconfig* file by using the Visual Studio Installer. You can then import the configuration into new or existing installations, use them to create or modify a layout or an offline installation, and share them with others.

## Export a configuration

You can export an installation configuration file from either a previously installed instance of Visual Studio or one that you're currently installing.

1. Open the Visual Studio Installer.

1. On the product card, choose the **More** button, and then select **Export configuration**.

1. Browse to or type the location where you want to save your .vsconfig file, and then choose **Review details**.

1. Make sure you've got the workloads and components that you want, and then choose **Export**.

## Import a configuration

When you're ready to import an installation configuration file, follow these steps.

1. Open the Visual Studio Installer.

1. On the product card, choose the **More** button, and then select **Import configuration**.

1. Locate the .vsconfig file that you want to import, and then choose **Review details**.

1. Make sure you've got the workloads and components that you want, and then choose **Close**.

## Use a configuration file to add components to an existing installation
 
Use `--config` to modify an existing installation to add or remove components. This example uses the installer already on the client machine.

```shell
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\setup.exe" modify --installPath "C:\VS" --config "C:\myconfig.vsconfig"
```

> [!NOTE]
> To add or remove components to an existing installation by using a config file (*.vsconfig), you'll need to **modify** your installed product and not update. Update just updates the components, not add or remove new ones.

When you install Visual Studio programmatically or by using a command prompt, you can use various command-line parameters to control or customize the installation. To learn more, see [Install Visual Studio from the command line](use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md).

## Use a configuration file to initialize the contents of a layout

Using the correct bootstrapper that corresponds to the version and edition of Visual Studio that you want, open an administrator command prompt and run the following command to use `-config` to configure the contents of a layout:

```shell
vs_enterprise.exe --layout c:\localVSlayout --config c:\myconfig.vsconfig --lang en-US 
```

## Automatically install missing components

Save a .vsconfig file to your solution root directory and then open a solution. Visual Studio automatically detects the missing components and prompts you to install them.

You can also generate a .vsconfig file right from Solution Explorer.

1. Right-click on your solution file.

1. Choose **Add** > **Installation Configuration File**.

1. Confirm the location where you want to save the .vsconfig file, and then choose **Review details**.

1. Make sure you've got the workloads and components that you want, and then choose **Export**.
