# Administrative Templates (ADMX) 

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]
 
 IT Administrators in organizations may want to control certain aspects of Visual Studio behavior to achieve consistency, compliance, or compatibility across the organization. The easiest way to do this is to configure group policies.
 
 The Visual Studio Administrative Templates (ADMX) consolidate the various Visual Studio policies into different categories, making them easily discoverable. The Visual Studio ADMX files can then integrate with standard management and deployment tools such as [Group Policy Editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn265982(v=ws.11)) or [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-endpoint-manager). IT Administrators can learn what policies are available and then configure and deploy the appropriate settings to the client machines. 
 
 The Visual Studio group policy settings contained in the ADMX file are machine-wide for all users, meaning they intend to cover all applicable installed instances, versions, and SKUs of Visual Studio. Sometimes a policy is particular to a specific version of Visual Studio, and the template clearly calls this out. 
 
 ## Visual Studio Policy Categories
 
 There are four main categories of Visual Studio policies that are included in the Visual Studio Administrator Templates (ADMX):
    - Feedback - controls behavior of the send-a-smile feature.
    - [Install and Update](/visualstudio/install/set-defaults-for-enterprise-deployments.md) - controls product acquisition behavior 
    - [Live Share](https://aka.ms/vsls-policies) - controls user and hosts settings
    - Privacy - controls [Intellicode](/visualstudio/intellicode/intellicode-privacy) and [Customer Experience Improvement Program](https://aka.ms/vs/admx/telemetry) settings
 
 ## Acquiring the Visual Studio Administrator Templates (ADMX)
 
 The [Visual Studio Administrator Templates (ADMX)](https://aka.ms/vs/admx/details) are available to download from the Microsoft Download Center. The default installation path is "C:\Windows\PoliciyDefinitions", which makes it instantly visible to the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.exe) tool, but you can install them anywhere.  
 
 ## Using Microsoft Endpoint Manager to deploy the policies
 
 You can use the Visual Studio Administrator Templates (ADMX) within enterprise management tools such as [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction) to configure and control client machines. 

For cloud connected environements that are managed by Intune, you can [import Visual Studio Administrator Templates (ADMX)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/administrative-templates-import-custom#add-the-admx-and-adml-files) and the [create configuration profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/administrative-templates-import-custom#create-a-profile-using-your-imported-files) based on the imported files. Eventually, Visual Studio Administrator Templates will be built natively into the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager enviroment](https://endpoint.microsoft.com), so this additional import step will be unnecessary. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Visual Studio Administrator Templates (ADMX) depend on the Windows administrator template (Windows.admx), so make sure you manually import that one in too.]
