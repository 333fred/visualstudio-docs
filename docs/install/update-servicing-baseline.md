# Update Visual Studio while on a servicing baseline

Visual Studio 2019 will have frequent updates during its [product lifecycle](/visualstudio/productinfo/release-rhythm#release-channel-updates). These will include both minor release updates (for example: 16.0 to 16.1) that can include new features and components, and servicing updates (for example: 16.0.4 to 16.0.5) containing only targeted fixes for critical issues. 

Enterprise administrators can choose to keep their clients on a servicing baseline, which is supported with servicing updates for a year past the release of the next servicing baseline. This allows more flexibility for developers and administrators to adopt the new features, bug fixes, or components included in new minor updates. The first servicing baseline is 16.0.x. See [Support options for enterprise and professional customers](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/releases/2019/servicing#support-options-for-enterprise-and-professional-customers) for more information.

## How to get onto a servicing baseline

To start using a servicing baseline, download a fixed version Visual Studio Installer bootstrapper from [My.VisualStudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202019%20version%2016.0). These bootstrappers have links to the product configurations, workloads, and components for that specific version. 

> [!NOTE]
> Be careful to distinguish between the fixed version bootstrapper and the normal bootstrappers. The normal bootstrappers are configured to use the latest available release of Visual Studio. They have a number in the filename (for example: vs_enterprise__123456789-123456789.exe) when downloaded from my.visualstudio.com.

During install, enterprise administrators need to configure their clients to prevent them from updating to the latest release. This can be done by [changing the channelUri setting in the response configuration file](update-servicing-baseline.md#install-a-servicing-baseline-on-a-network) to use a channel manifest in the layout or local folder, by [modifying the channelUri through command-line execution](update-servicing-baseline.md#install-a-servicing-baseline-via-the-internet) to use a non-existent file, or by [setting policies on the client system to disable updates](update-servicing-baseline.md#use-policy-settings-to-disable-clients-from-updating) to prevent clients from self-updating. 

### Install a servicing baseline on a network

For administrators using a network layout install, modify the channelUri value in `response.json` in the layout to use the channelmanifest.json that is in the same folder. See [Control updates to network-based Visual Studio deployments](controlling-updates-to-visual-studio-deployments.md) for step-by-step guidance. Changing the channelUri enables clients to look for updates in the layout location. 

### Install a servicing baseline via the internet

If it is an internet based install, add `--channelUri` with a non-existent channel manifest to the command-line used to launch setup. This disables Visual Studio from using the latest available release for an update. Here is an example:

  ```cmd
   vs_enterprise.exe --channelUri c:\doesnotexist.chman 
  ```

### Use policy settings to disable clients from updating

Another option to control updates on a client is to [turn off update notifications](controlling-updates-to-visual-studio-deployments.md). Use this option if the channelUri value was not changed on install. It will disable the client from receiving links to the latest available release. A fixed version bootstrapper is still necessary to update to a specific version on the client.

## How to stay on a servicing baseline

When there is an update for a servicing baseline, fixed version bootstrapper files are made available for the servicing update from [My.VisualStudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202019%20version%2016.0). These can be used in several scenarios.

For administrators deploying via network layout install, the administrator will want to update the [layout location](update-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md). Clients that installed from the location will receive update notifications. If the update needs to be deployed to clients, follow [these instructions](update-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md#how-to-deploy-an-update-to-client-machines). When modifying the 'response.json' for an update, do not add additional workloads, components, or languages. Managing these settings must be done as a 'modify' deployment after the product has been updated. 

If it is an internet based install, run the new fixed version bootstrapper with the `--channelUri` parameter pointing to a non-existent channel manifest on the client. If the update is deployed in quiet or passive mode, use two separate commands:

1. First, update the Visual Studio installer: <br>```vs_enterprise.exe --quiet --update```
2. Then, update the Visual Studio application itself: <br>```vs_enterprise.exe update --installPath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise" --quiet --wait --norestart --channelUri c:\doesnotexist.chman```
